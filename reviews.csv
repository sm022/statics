"Posted: 11 AugustI’m a game developer and I’m overwhelmed with how toxic the industry has become in the last 10 years due to greed and venture capital. Games have transformed from actual toys to play and have fun to machines for juicing and parasiting on users’ addictions and cravings.In that context of our society, Dave The Diver is an amazing relief and gives me back my inner child passion to get back to making videogames that really are fun to play, to make an art form with love, to make content just for the sake of telling a good interactive story, to give a nice moment to people.This game is a 10/10. It never stops giving you new content and new core mechanics even in the late game. The game has lots of minigames to solve, and when you thought you’ve seen and perfected all the core mechanics, suddenly a new map, town, or challenge is unlocked with completely new mechanics to learn and master. It doesn’t recycle too much, it doesn’t take the easy path, its development demonstrates what is really possible when you make something with love and real effort and not just for an easy cash grab.I want more games like this. I want to make games like this. Not a single lootbox in sight. Not a single child becoming a gambler as an adult.",0.13965302374393282

"Posted: 3 MarchEarly Access ReviewThe trailers do a good job of explaining what the core gameplay loop will be. Dive into the ocean collecting fish, turn that fish into sushi to use at the restaurant where customers pay you money, turn the money into upgrades, go back to diving with better gear, rinse and repeat.What may not come across quite as strongly is how well paced and soothing everything is. Diving around for fish does have moments of punctuated panic where you're trying to expertly dodge sharks, or land shots with your harpoon gun to reel in that particularly agile fish you've been hunting; but the vast majority of the time is simply exploring the ever-changing cove and gently floating alongside the local marine life.The jumps between the panic and the breezy bits is really well done. The restaurant management makes for a nice change of pace between your dives and the additional layers that come later (I'll refrain from mentioning the other things you'll visit/ manage later in the game) mean that even after 16 hours; I was still finding new directions that the game would go in.There's not a lot more to say than that. The animations are delightful, the characters and the dialogue is funny, and the gameplay hits the note between panic and relaxation really well. I'd heartily recommend Dave the Diver and I'm looking forward to where else this game goes once it's out of early access.",0.1672878787878788

And it made me laugh out loud several times because of the characters and the story. It's over the top. Beside all of that the diving is very relaxing and the game doesn't hurry you up so you can make sushi and sell it at your own tempo and upgrade your stuff before you want to go deeper into the story. The upgrades are great and realy help you along deeper/diving into the game. Yep, Dave hit several of my game spots. I really like Sushi by the way.",0.11890119684237334
"Posted: September 3Product received for freeDave the Diver is an extremely diverse, distinctive, and captivating adventure RPG. It does not stick to a specific genre and has constant surprises for players. I have never played anything even remotely similar and am blown away at the amount of interesting concepts jumbled masterfully together to create the memorable experience that is, Dave the Diver. This astonishing Indie is well deserving of its “overwhelmingly positive” rating here on Steam and I am ecstatic to see it rightfully receiving its success and well-deserved recognition.ProsConstant new content to learn & discover that regularly evolvesExtremely addictive & distinctive gameplay loopImmense attention to detailBrilliant pacing and delivery of new conceptsQuirky pixel artComedic dialogueConsProlonged loading screensMinor mechanics not fully explainedIf you would like to see more reviews written by me, please follow my curator page and help support my workCookie Reviews.StoryYou play as Dave, and you guessed it, he is a diver. Dave begins diving in the “blue hole” which is a marine biological hotspot that provides habitat to a diverse range of aquatic life. Dave dives and collects marine life to be used in the accompanying sushi shop. Dave soon finds himself entangled in the mystery of a long-forgotten “sea people” civilisation and will use his diving skills to discover more about them and help various other characters along the way.Whilst there is a strong narrative in the game, the characters are all so lovingly wacky. From the Anime-girl-obsessed-gun-making nerd, to the stoic sushi chef, or the vegetable loving rapper. Despite the crazy characters, there are fantastic foundations for each of them and I adored them all.DAVE THE DIVERA Screenshot of DAVE THE DIVERBy:Mz CookiesGameplay: Brief synopsisAs aforementioned, I have never played a game with as much variation as Dave the Diver, but I will attempt to explain the core gameplay. During the day, Dave is able to dive into the ocean, explore it, collect fish via various methods, pick up objects, complete quests etc. At night, the sushi bar opens and he will help serve there. This means typical Cooking Dash style gameplay, running around clicking on food and taking it to the customer and serving drinks. Have to be quick though, as customers do not have high patience levels. Dave will earn money after each sushi serving shift and this can then be used on upgrades and many other things. The games pacing is absolutely fantastic despite the enormous amount of extra content that gets added later, things are introduced slowly and are generally easy to understand. Perhaps the biggest downfall about this game is the lie I would tell myself after playing until the early hours of the morning, saying “one more dive, then I will go to bed.” Definitely not.DivingIn the beginning, Dave can only dive to limited depths and has restricted cargo capacity. These will increase as different elements are upgraded such as oxygen tank capacity etc. Dave can hunt fish via a variety of methods, using a harpoon to manually pull fish in, or various guns and tools. Everything can be upgraded and there are also different types that can be added such as incendiary, poison or tranquiliser. Bigger fish such as sharks require more effort and stronger guns, and sometimes quick time events will trigger where a button must be mashed to pull in a fish. While diving, Dave must be careful of his oxygen levels as if it runs out, he will need to be rescued resulting in everything in his inventory being lost except 1 item. Oxygen also acts as his health, and if hurt by other fishes or the environment, his oxygen levels will quickly deplete. There are lots of goodies to be found in exploration that can be used in crafting and also includes plenty of oxygen spots to refuel. As the game progresses, players will have access to further locations such as glacier waters, caves and of course, the deep sea. Each area has unique fish to be discovered, with over 200 to find in total.DAVE THE DIVERA Screenshot of DAVE THE DIVERBy:Mz CookiesCombatThere is a decent amount of combat in the game, including many boss fights. The boss fights are all exceptionally different and vary in difficulty. As said earlier, guns can be crafted and upgraded to help in the battles. Specific fish will also automatically target Dave if he gets close and these first encounters can actually be quite scary, specifically with the large sharks!CookingFurther to the basic Cooking Dash style mechanics, the menu must be selected daily based off the fish Dave brings back from his adventures. Recipes must be researched, additional staff can be hired, décor can be purchased and later in the game, even a second branch of the shop can be opened and managed. Each dish is priced differently, usually depending on rarity and can be upgraded with special items to increase its value and “tastiness”.  This variation from diving to serving was absolutely phenomenal and kept me addicted from the get-go.ExtrasI cannot possibly describe everything in this game as there is just too much, and it constantly switches genre. However, some of the highlights include having a fish farm, VIP visits, cooking competitions, rhythm mini games, managing a vegetable farm, side quests, taking photos of wildlife, chase sequences, puzzles, unique segments controlling two characters at once, riding a beluga whale, tranquilising large sharks and using a drone to transport them back to the fish farm and so, so much more. The game can easily be continued after completing the story and there is enough in management style mechanics to keep you busy for hundreds of hours. From collecting all of the fish, to running a successful fish and vegetable farm, to operating and managing your sushi employees and second branch. No two dives are the same.Visuals & SoundDave the Diver is visually stunning, utilising a combination of pixel art with 2D/3D art to create a beautiful oceanic environment brimming with aquatic life. Seeing whales, turtles and manta rays created a sense of awe within me. A testament to the efficacy of the gorgeous environment.DAVE THE DIVERA Screenshot of DAVE THE DIVERBy:Mz CookiesThe soundtrack is casual yet addictive, giving a laidback beach vibe, but ramping up the stress during fast-paced sequences. Characters are not voiced, but speak in a robotic monotone voice that at first I didn’t like, but it grew on me shortly after.Technical & StatsThis game was played using a keyboard & mouse, and with the following PC specs.:AMD Ryzen R5 7600x 5.4 GHz32GB DDR5 5200 CL36 RAMRadeon RX 6800 XT2560x1440 resolutionNVMe 3.0 SSDWindows 10Playtime:22-25 hours to complete the story. 50+ hours for completionists, or plenty of additional content to enjoy after finishing the game.Controller Recommended?Player choiceConclusionDave the Diver is an experience that I will hardly forget and is well deserving of its many accolades. It is almost unbelievable that developers managed to pack this much content into one Indie game and make it not only coherent, but brilliant. From a quirky story, an extremely addictive gameplay loop to new engaging mechanics introduced throughout the entirety of the game, there is an abundance to love and I highly recommend it at its bargain full price cost of only $AU29.99.Follow our curator page,IndieGemsif you enjoyed this review and wish to see more like it",0.11969840208810793

"Posted: August 16Dave the Diver is A LOT of things and it's not shocking how all the reviews are OVERWHELMINGLY positive.You hunt and photograph fish, farm fish and food, unravel mysteries deep underwater, and help run a sushi restaurant. While it all sounds like a lot, it honestly is pretty well balanced. I was surprised just how much content was in the game, especially with it being a $20 indie game.The basis of the game and the controls were very simple to understand, yet the game still had a lot of depth to it. The music was amazing and complemented the gameplay really well. The visuals and graphics were full of detail and looked beautiful even for being a pixel-like style.The characters and the cut-scenes are THE BEST PART in my opinion. From an anime-obsessed gun maker to cooking competitions between chefs, the cut-scenes are just *chefs kiss.* I took so many screenshots because of dumb, funny, or cool visuals.There was also an assortment of boss fights and underwater puzzles that kept the game interesting. There are a ton of different weapons to craft and also a bunch of unique weapons you can find while exploring!I cannot stress enough just how much stuff is packed into this little game.Few small things I didn't like:- The mouse icon isn't at all themed towards the game. While this sounds like something so minimal (and it is tbh), it sticks out like a sore thumb compared to all of the amazing art and details that the game has.- There weren't a lot of graphic settings. I kept getting some tearing and unfortunately, there was no vsync option. You can basically only change the resolution. Not a huge deal but having options is always nice.- For how much content is in the game, it can feel a bit repetitive at times. It's a constant gameplay loop of checking all your farms, diving, running the restaurant, etc that eventually gave me burnout but that may have just been because I was 100%ing the game.It probably took me around 30hrs to beat and 57hrs to 100%.I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure and restaurant management games/sims. It's a great game to just relax and chill out on.",0.07875000000000001

I would chop wood and fish when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music. But when I played Dave the Diver first time, my whole life changed. The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in life, too.

"Posted: November 8, 2022Early Access ReviewAfter 40 hours, and 100% completing this early access game, I can say that it's one of the most fun I've played. I keep playing even though there is nothing left to do, and there is no more fish to catch because it is still enjoyable after.

"Posted: January 9Early Access ReviewThis is a very cute, addictive, and stylish game with a lot of potential. My only complaint is that progression in this game seemed too quick for a restaurant management game. With the gameplay loop being as satisfying as it is, I think the game would benefit from slower progression, allowing the players to just relax, explore, and enjoy their time working towards the growth of their restaurant. Slowing the progression of the game down, coupled with enhancements to the procedural generation of the game so that it feels more varied on each dive, I would very much like to see.Overall, this game has a lot of potential. I fell in love with the gameplay, design, music, and style. I just wish that progression was slower so that I could spend more time just diving, cooking, and managing my business.",0.04035353535353534

"Posted: December 31, 2022Early Access ReviewThis is a fun little game about diving in the ocean, exploring the depths, then savagely murdering every creature in sight as a sacrifice to the gods of capitalism.The atmosphere is quite nice, characters and creatures are done in a pretty good looking pixel art format, the soundtrack is quite pleasant and generally fits the themes and moods.  There’s plenty of little mini games, events and gameplay variety to keep things fresh beyond the loop of ‘jump in, kill fish, make money’ and overall I found the game engaging all the way through until the end of the early access chapters.  Just about every cutscene is worth watching at least once - they’re incredibly stylish and good for a chuckle.The game makes a big deal about using procgen environments and that “every dive is different” but I honestly didn’t see much of that.   Creature spawns are more or less static and the areas themselves rarely change their layout beyond small, superficial things.  It doesn’t really take away much from the gameplay loop itself, and I probably wouldn’t have even thought about it if the game didn’t make such a big show about calling it out in the first place.My biggest complaint is the controls.   They’re quite clunky, to the point that I’d say the #1 cause of dying for the time I played this was due to some kind of control mishap.  It baffles me a bit that in a game about being underwater and more or less free from the idea of gravity that your aim is locked in to +/- 45 degrees horizontally with no way to aim any higher or lower without awkwardly repositioning poor Dave in the midst of having his butt chomped off by an angry shark.  The choice to require a button press to begin aiming the weapon with a totally separate button to actually fire, neither of which is terribly responsive, can be equally frustrating in more dangerous moments.Adding to that frustration is dying during a boss fight/event section commits the mortal sin of making you rewatch all the unskippable cutscenes/intros every single time you restart it - please, a skip button.   I beg you.I do hope the world generation and control issues get polished up before the game releases, but even if they don’t this is still worth a play if you’re in to the vaguely roguelite gameplay loop and exploration stuff.",0.03779220779220777

That being said....I started this game at 7pm and stopped playing, only because adulting dictated i needed to, at 3.45am. i was having a blast! each time i was like ok ill complete this and then do go to bed, but a special event happened, or i got a new upgrade. there is SO MUCH CONTENT for early access. how much will there be for the whole game?! if its any indication, its got to be a big game. im really looking forward to playing more, and for the full release. hopefully our progress will be saved and added with full release, but honestly if not, im game to replay! as far as the graphics and game play, i did run into 2 issues. only 2 bugs for an early release is damn good! bringing your phone out will sometimes cause a red and black screen, ive had that happen 3 times in almost 9 hours of game play. i started the dive and my character never showed up in the ocean. that happened once. so 4 bugs in 9 hours for early access is amazing! also, for those who are a fan of Food Wars, it does have some vibes with the vips. thats all ill say.HAPPY FISHING!",0.028743042671614105
"Posted: January 14Early Access ReviewDAVE THE DIVER... one more dive and it´s 2 a.m.The game in a nutshellDAVE THE DIVER is a pixel-art management action-adventure. Dive by day and run a sushi bar in the evening. Apart from managing your staff, enobling your interior, collecting ingredients and obviously hunting fish for your menu card (which you change daily depending on your hunting success) this game offers much more, but I´ll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible - it needs to be experienced. The gameplay loop though is highly addictive and once you think you´ve seen it all the game surprises you with another possibility to expand your business, another activity as e.g. mini games or one of its genious and charming cutscenes that introduce the next story or continue a previous.+/-+ beautifully designed - the art style, atmosphere and music/sounds are great and perfectly underline the game´s mood+ explore the ocean and decide what it´ll be on today´s menu+ lovable characters with amusing interactions+ hilarious cutscenes and humor in general+ many pop culture references+ manage your to-do´s, crafting, social media and more with apps on your ingame cellphone+ time events that are always managable+ very polished for an EA game+ as mentioned the gameplay loop is highly addictive - 18 hours in three days says it all+ several storylines, all of which intertwine beautifully+ end bosses for some of the quests and stories+ easy 100% for those who care about achievements+/- although the game uses procedurally generated environments, most of the areas repeat themselves - I hope that this feature will be strengthened in future updates for more variety during the dives- the only negative for me is the QTE parts that appear when you try catching some of the high tier fish, but that depends on and minimizes when you get better gear. The reason behind is just a skill issue - as an older gamer my reflexes are in a downward spiral and I totally suck at QTE...ConclusionAlthough it´s just January 2023 this already is personal GOTY material and there is a reason for the overwhelmingly positive rewievs it has. DAVE THE DIVER still is in Early Access and I´m thrilled for its upcoming content. And since we´re talking about a food related game I´d like to mention that a good meal, and in this case the game itself, is the outcome of the right mix of ingredients, passion and invested love for every step of the work. And that you can feel in every single corner of the game, the attention to detail is truly amazing. This game is so good and entertaining that time really runs and I had to force myself to go to bed. Highly recommended if you´re looking for something unique that already is a masterpiece in its current EA state!",0.20515954475631884

Don't let the pixel graphics fool you, this game has a lot of gameplay elements and story in it.You are a diver during the day and have to explore the sea to catch fish, find treasure and react to any sudden situations. You basically have an Oxygen meter to determine how long you can stay under the sea. It is also your HP meter, if you are hurt, you will lose some oxygen. When you are out of air, you will be saved and taken back to your ship but you can only retrieve one item.For any fish or sea creature you caught, you sent to your restaurant for it to open for the night. You have a restaurant management mini game which you have to design the menu (from what you caught in the morning or from previous day's leftover), manage your staff, and serve your customers. Repeat the next day. The good thing about this game is that there are alot of side missions and quests for you to tend to during your undersea adventure. I won't get into too much detail here but there are still new stuff unlocking after 10 hours of play time.Anyways here is a quick summary of pros and cons of this game:Pros:+ Lots of gameplay elements+ Multiple storylines+ Loveable characters and main protagonist+ Relaxing but occasionally gives you a sense of danger and make you fight for your life.Cons:- Some Quality of life changes needed...e.g.1. the drink pouring minigame continues for like 5 seconds even after you finished pouring and locks you out from doing other stuff... and if you don't entertain them they get angry and leaves...UPDATE:Turns out you can train your staff to supply drinks so they deliberately makes you suffer at first to make you appreciate your upgrades more.e.g.2. no game loading unless you go back to the main menu, you either make it entirely impossible to load, or you allow us to easily load please)UPDATE: still no load game and only 3 auto saves, need to rely on alt+f4 in order to preserve auto saves otherwise they will be easily overwritten.e.g.3. claims the map is randomly generated but there are only a few variations with the same layout, so you will get familiar with them over time.UPDATE: no change, a bit disappointed to be honest, but not a deal breaker-still in early access makes you wanting for more!! (okay not really a con but man I want the full game so badly)FULL GAME HAS RELEASED!Update after beating the full release:So it has been a few months and I have put in 30 more hours to complete the game. This game still holds and manage to give me enjoyment from start to end, makes me wanting for more. Though, I can say there are two different meaning of completion with this game. Most people would end it after clearing the main story and probably after getting all achievements. This requires around 30-40 hours. I had a bug so I had to go and replay parts of the game again for one final achievement. And then there are the 100% completion crew. To get 100% completion (e.g. all dishes/staff/weapons upgraded), I can see you will probably need another 30-40 hours. The gap in between finishing the game and 100% the game is colossal. I would love to 100% the game normally but the great effort required made me gave it up. I am sure some people would love this and the game company actually gave you a choice by not forcing any achievements on that is great. Just make sure you note this.Some notes worth mentioning:+ Released some other QoL changes that removes the button mashing from the game. This wasn't a problem in my original review because I was playing with mouse and keyboard at first. During full game I tried playing with a controller and that was where the problem comes in. But the devs listened to the community and added accessibility options to simply have you hold the buttons so finally no more button mashing!- Upgrade cost for staff for the final 5 levels are crazy. Materials required for the final few levels of dish upgrades are also crazy. In general the climb is very steep near the end for each staff/dish upgrade (while the return on investment is the same as before).- Occasional bugs still exist (normal but still happened too often and had to mention) or not unlocking achievements.",0.03563798093292475
"Posted: November 10, 2022Early Access ReviewIn ""Dave the Diver"" you play as Dave, who is not just a diver but also a manager/server at a restaurant, and a farmer of both plants and fish.  The core game play loop is Dave diving to collect fish and managing your restaurants menu.  Within the game you'll also explore the depths of the (as of current two) ocean maps, complete various quests given to you by a host of unique and fun characters, manage your restaurant by hiring/training staff, and overseeing your fish/rice farm.The game starts you exploring a small portion of a what it calls a constant changing pocket of the ocean (again only two maps as of now) wherein after learning the controls you'll become a server in the restaurant slowly opening up more game play as you progress.Things done well in my opinion:- The core game play loop is enjoyable- There's a lot to do in the game- The NPS are silly, entertaining, and the dialog is fairly well written- Animations are over the top and a joy to watch (skippable after repeated viewings)- The oxygen as health bar mechanic adds a nice level of tension to the gameWhat needs work in my opinion:- There's a delay in trying to rapid fire your speargun that's annoying and makes fighting fast moving fish annoying- It has the ""Mario"" mechanic where simply touching an enemy damages you, when fighting larger fish this can be very annoying as the tail or fins will destroy you in close combat- Fish can get inside your hit box wherein you're unable to repel them.  If you're heavy this can outright kill you as you're unable to escape- It would be nice to be able to change the music around and ""Set"" it to different locations.  As it is now, you can listen to any of the music you unlocked in the game on your phone but that's all you can do with it.Overall ""Dave the Diver"" is quite a fun game and I would recommend it to others.",-0.0326923076923077

"Posted: July 10You might say to yourself - How can I possibly lose dozens of hours in a game revolving around running a Sushi restaurant? And for under $20?I can't stress enough how incredible this game is. I ran out of positive adjectives to say about this game due to me trying to express my profound love for what exists. It's like climbing up your favorite hill, only to realize it's a mountain. But not only is it a mountain, but the largest mountain on earth - only to reveal that it's bigger than that. The audacity of this game to be this good, and so surprising and refreshing for so long borders on illegal.This game is everything you expect and then tons and tons of things you don't expect - ALL of them fantastic and capable of being their OWN game. Hours into this immersive game, more and more things are being unlocked. Every random tangent you swim on or cook leads you down a rabbit hole of other tangents and unlocks.This is my game of the year and slowly creeping its way into my game of the last 5 years.

"Posted: October 15""Just one more dive...""I bought this game completely on a whim because I kept seeing it advertised everywhere and saw all the glowing  reviews. I went in blind, not knowing much besides ""catch fish during day, sell them at night."" I was expecting something with a very simple concept like Moonlighter but I was pleased to see it's much more than that and there's a lot to unpack here and so much to enjoy. There's a lot I personally love about the game.- The addictive gameplay of filling out essentially a fish pokedex (like animal crossing)- The satisfying loop of catching a bunch of fish, selling them at the restaurant you manage, and using the money to upgrade Dave's diving equipment so you can progress further, deal more damage, upgrade oxygen tank, etc.- Wonderful soundtrack. It's got tense scores during boss fights to just more relaxing chill music while on a peaceful dive, and I'm someone who almost never pays attention to the soundtrack in games.- Even many hours in I was pleased to still be unlocking new content (for example, a farm to grow more crops for your dishes)- Some of the random minigames are so much fun. I wasn't expecting to suddenly have to play a rhythm minigame sequence as Duff, the anime loving neckbeard who provides Dave with weapon upgrades, but it gave me a good laugh and just shook up the gameplay a bit.- All the characters are so charming, even smaller characters are so fleshed out, such as a rapper named MC Sammy who has a popular song called ""Hot Pepper Tuna""This is one of those games where it's very clear where all the hype comes from once you play it.

"Posted: August 1Product received for freeDave the Diver is a relentlessly enjoyable experience. When I played the demo months ago, I could tell that it was something unique and fun, but I had no idea that the final product would be packed with so much content while also remaining cohesive and endearing throughout. Then, to top it all off, it has some of the most hilarious and well-made pixel art cutscenes I have ever encountered. You can stop here and just play it, but if you need more convincing, continue below.Abbreviated Review:YouTube™ Video:Dave the Diver Review - Sushi Saves the SeaViews: 1,043Everyone you know has already told you to play this game. If you somehow made it to this video without that happening, congratulations, I'm happy I get to be the first one to tell you.Meet DaveThe innocuous beginning of Dave the Diver makes it seem like you’re in for a run-of-the-mill management sim and side-scrolling ‘shooter’ of some sort. Your protagonist Dave is a seemingly mild-mannered and friendly guy who takes on any task presented to him with a smile. So, in addition to be-ing the sole diver hunting fish in the occasionally hostile environment of an island-encompassed blue hole, you’ll also be managing the menu, financials, décor, and being the primary server in the restaurant. The only thing you won’t be doing (mostly) is crafting the sushi itself – which is left to your mysterious hardnosed Chef Bancho.Bancho, like many of the noteworthy characters in the game, has a small story that you get to explore within the gameplay. Character exploration is part of the larger narrative in what ultimately becomes a fairly expansive story with a lot of mysteries and discoveries within it. Like the blue hole itself, the adventure seems basic on the surface but is actually deep and full of secrets. While initially your goals are only stocking and running a restaurant, various characters will wander out to meet you on the dive platform of your small boat to request your assistance in several unique and iterative quest chains. Some of these chains weave into the core of the story while others are just extra tasks that can provide rewards and keep the game rich.The money that you earn as a reward from some of these quests adds to your primary source of income – the restaurant. This money can be used for many tasks and resources including augmenting the restaurant as well as upgrading your gear to dive deeper, longer, and with better tools to keep you alive. The deeper you go, the more threats you’ll face, but you’ll also encounter rarer sea creatures that can be diced into more profitable dishes at the restaurant. However, that’s only a small portion of what you’ll find in the depths.The AbyssOne interesting aspect of the journey through Dave the Diver is the process of unlocking the things you need to make it into new environments. You’ll, of course, need more air available as it’s not only for breathing but also functions as your health bar. Any time you’re stung by a jellyfish or snapped at by a shark, you’ll lose air – while also steadily losing it as you breathe. You can find barrels of that life-retaining substance randomly on the sea floor along with chests full of one-time-use resources like underwater scooters and temporary oxygen boosts. You’ll also find chests with new spear tips, guns, and melee weapons you’ll need to fend off and take down larger predators and prey.Part of the unique challenge any time you dive into the ocean is that you have a sort of roguelike experience where you need to obtain stronger spears and weapons and the environment is slightly different. The undersea environment isn’t procedurally generated, so you will see the same map over several dives, but there are at least a handful of maps to navigate that change with the time of day. However, with the random nature of the items you obtain each time and the progressively more challenging creatures that appear as the story moves forward, it feels a lot more diverse than it is.The chapter-based campaign is blocked out by the main quest line that uses key items to limit your overall progression. While you can upgrade your oxygen and suit to go deeper as well as your harpoon and weapons to fish more efficiently, even your first steps into deeper water require you to complete a quest for a headlamp. You can sit around avoiding the main quest to fish endlessly and run the restaurant, but the game is built around the excellent pacing that has you balancing that aspect with exploration and mystery quite well. Of the 25 hours it took me to finish the main part of the game, I made only a handful of dives that weren’t connected in some way toward progression.Riding the CurrentDave the Diver’s pacing works so well because it always gives you something new to do. The number of minigames and evolving mechanics is astounding. From the simplest tasks like having a different minigame for reeling in a big fish using each different spear tip to an immersive rhythm-based music challenge you can revisit at any time, you will never be complacent. It was almost overwhelming at times with how any given moment you could be using a mechanic you have never seen before to accomplish your next task. There are entire moments crafted in the game using controls and functionality that happen a single time, which almost seems wasteful if it wasn’t also fun as hell.Between the minigames, boss fights, ever-expanding roles of spearfishing and restaurant management, and the hilarious cutscenes sprinkled throughout the game, I was blown away by everything presented. For a mere $20, this game provided one of the best experiences I’ve had in an indie game in a long time, and I am hoping that this isn’t the end of the adventure for Dave. The ongoing nature of serving new dishes in the restaurant and the potential to unlock more secret caves or deeper adventures leaves plenty of room for more content. However, even if somehow the developers don’t seize that opportunity, this game is well worth picking up and diving into.If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:Endyo's Indies,Abbreviated Reviews",0.14054670077397347

"Posted: February 20Early Access ReviewI really want to like the game because it is a ton of fun besides one aspect. What is ruining my experience as an older gamer/developer with karpal-tunnel issues are the button mashing controls needed in many aspects of the gameplay. It is ruining my peripheral inputs, that is also why I stopped playing it on the steam deck. I do not think having to mash space-bar, left-mouse, or a button input 20 times in a five second interval is good for your hand and wrist health.I wish the developers would change their approach and instead like they do it on some harpoons require a key sequence to be entered, aka W, A, space-bar e.g. Maybe give an option in the settings to activate sequential input mode, so people can decide between button mashing or a less hardware and wrist/hand-straining input method.I will gladly change my review once this has been addressed or changed, for now I do not recommend this game for anyone who is concerned about their peripheral health or has issues mashing the same input over and over in a short burst.EDIT: Well, seems like we got heard and the devs are addressing the button-mashing issues. So I will gladly change my review to recommend the game! Thanks for listening to the feedback and solving the issue devs! :)",0.1264705882352941
"Posted: March 19Early Access ReviewThere hasn't been a game that's captivated me like this has in quite some time. I've put close to 12 hours in and think I'm near the end of the early access content but I keep being surprised by new mechanics that open up. There's a lot more to this game than initially meets the eye, and the mechanics are rolled out slowly enough that you feel like you have firm footing at every stage of the game.So far, I truly can't find fault with this. The game just oozes character. The art and animations are superb. The music is great. The mechanics are actually pretty interesting and non-trivial (don't be turned off by the ""casual"" tag - there is definitely some challenge to both parts of the game). At the same time, they're not super stressful - the restaurant part of the game isn't a cakewalk (I rarely have a perfect night) but it's a far cry from something like Overcooked.I haven't found myself genuinely smiling or laughing at a game like I have with this in a long time. To have that alongside genuinely interesting gameplay and all around good vibes is a treat. Definitely recommend checking this out.",0.09302112029384758
"Posted: September 4I usually dislike fishing mini-games in other games, so I had my doubts when I saw that this one was ABOUT fishing. However, it was a pleasant surprise how much I enjoyed the game and how entertained I was while fishing. It never got tiring (well, except maybe taking care of the Tamagotchi, haha).This is a fishing game with several other interesting mechanics. Surprisingly for me, it has a story, and quite an interesting one at that, with fantastic humor. Excellent pixel art, and let's not even get started on the music! This game has such great music; I can't get enough of it.Basically, our main character, Dave, is invited to an exotic island to try some delicious sushi, but surprisingly, they actually want him to go diving... and, by the way, be a waiter/manager/farmer/fish breeder/card collector/photographer and researcher... among many other activities... Poor Dave, 24 hours a day are not enough.I found all the mini-games very entertaining, except for the Tamagotchi, mostly because when I was a kid, I hated how much attention it demanded, and the minigame reminded me of that.I think it's an excellent game to relax while doing some fishing, and if you like it get hooked on restaurant management. Lots of laughs with the cameos and references, as well as the game's overall sense humor; I had a blast, and I might even say I felt a bit sad when I finished it.I don't know what the devs are planning if they have more content in mind for the game or a sequel, but I'm definitely looking forward to any news!Highly recommended!",0.1628378378378378
"Posted: July 4The first several hours are fun, chill, and full of exploration and adventure as you go on the hunt, upgrade your gear, and plunge to new depths.

You can upgrade your shop recipes as you continue to get more stuff.  You can change the shop decoration as well as higher and level up staff of your choosing.

"Posted: July 2I got sucked into the initial gameplay loop, which felt like a really robust old Kongregate hidden gem with ""number go up"" upgrade progression revealing more and more systems that also want bigger numbers. But the momentum dies as the core loop keeps getting interrupted for more (and more (and more)) unskippable cutscenes, tutorials, and interruptions. I just sat down to play a quick fishing dive and the day started with two separate quest dialogues with new associated objectives (including one that consisted of calling another character to actually receive an objective). Then a reminder popped up about a two-day timer ticking down that I didn't initiate, and then I remembered tat the day before had set up an entirely new game mode separate from all that stuff with its own currencies and minigames with obsessively deep progression systems, the intro to all of which was set in a zone I couldn't save my progress in. I didn't go collect fish to sell at a sushi restaurant after all that; I just turned off the game instead.I want to say this is fun in bursts and that hopefully I come back. But right now I still feel like I'm waiting for the tutorials to stop so I can just enjoy my nostalgic game that feels like I'm on a Flash site in the late 2000s, and that is simultaneously surprising to experience at all in 2023 but also reaaaaaaally spoiled by unskippable, unsaveable stretches that are becoming more and more of my time playing rather than that nice nostalgic upgrade grind I was sold on.",0.1401175621763857

You then have the Sushi bar part which is you making the menu based on what fish you got and help out when customers comeIt is a wonderful mix and super chill. Also lastly the dialogue is great, its a real wholesome game in general but especially with the dialogue.If you want a fun chill and relaxing game that is a nice mix of adventure diving and fishing in the water and also sushi bar management give it a try!No joke at all when I say this is in my Top 10 games of 2022, which includes the likes of Elden Ring.

"Posted: October 14This is the single best rougelite I've ever played and it's not even close. Dave the diver combines the beauty of some of the most relaxing game play with beautiful visuals, incredibly funny dialogue and characters, and so so so much side content that I've unironically spent more time doing that than I have progressing the main story, you can beat this game in roughly 12 ish hours if you were just pushing for main story objectives, but the insane amount of side content and extra achievements and optional content INCLUDING optional boss fights will easily have you playing for 35-40 hours minimum. The games two main gameplay loops of diving for fish and working at the sushi resturant perfectly go hand in hand, and the more you play the game, the more you'll actually WANT to just be swimming around underneath the ocean doing basically nothing but catching wildlife, fighting sharks, helping people with sidequests, theres just an absurd amount of content here, this game could be 150% of hell even 200% of its current price on steam and I'd still say it's worth it, this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gem of a game and you're seriously missing out if you aren't playing it.",0.10903119868637108

My only complaint is that it is kinda short as I've been able to do most everything in it in about 15-20 hours of play, but it's only $20 and it's still in EA so I'm sure I'll be getting a lot more time out of it anyway.And they're constantly adding improvements as well. Was going to put in feedback that we could use a sort option in the recipe menu and they did in today's update (are they psychic?).Very addictive in all the right ways!Update post release:Still loving this game but with the full release, we've got some new content that doesn't feel fully fleshed out yet. Stuff like:Enemy movement can get kinda jankBug where the game forgot my keyboard existed (only once thankfully).Some minigames are a little wonky. Mario one has weird spacing and the stealth level is mehCould use more breathing room between eventsLess button mashing. Could use an accessibility option for it and just turn it down anyway. My keyboard is going to call the police on meOverall, still loving the game, would be a 10/10 were it not for the above issues and it's still like 9/10 with them. Excellent game that could use a couple updates.",0.11300067777340507

"Posted: January 28Early Access ReviewThis game is just perfect. Barely even played 2 hours and I can already confidently call it a masterpiece, and that's before it's even fully released! The gameplay loop is incredibly engaging; it uniquely blends two genres that are usually seen independently - exploration/resource gathering/crafting, and restaurant management/customisation. This works flawlessly and gives the game great variation, preventing it from growing stale, as you are swapping between these two fronts with great pacing. Both sides of the game are enjoyable and feel rewarding, with frequent feature unlocks that add additional layers to the game, customisation options, gear upgrades, and collectibles (namely a Pokémon-esque card system, a perfect optional feature for completionists).The combat feels fair and can honestly be avoided in many cases, making the game accessible for most players, as it caters to casual playstyles as well as allowing for more intense intentional challenge.The pixel art is gorgeous, 2.5D was the perfect choice of medium - the world is vivid and the art style feels unique. You can tell how much love was poured into it just through the visuals. There are detailed, animated pixel art cutscenes to accompany certain restaurant upgrades, and their inclusion showcases passion (as in, the game would feel no less whole if they were absent - their existence is just a cherry on top).10/10",0.275595238095238
"Posted: September 12( full review with screenshots:https://www.gaming-parrot.com/post/dave-the-diver-review-low-pressure-diving)I wish I could leave a neutral score, but given the options I'm closer to recommending it than not.Dave the Diver is a laid back game about diving into a semi-randomized ocean trench in order to catch loads of exotic fish to supply a sushi restaurant. Or, at least, that's what it is at the beginning. Dave will still be a diver at the end of the game, but along the way he'll end up moonlighting as a waiter, a farmer, a gambler, and many, many other things. There have been plenty of games over the years that start with a ridiculously ambitious concept and only implement half the systems you'd expect, but Dave starts with a very simple concept and dumps an MMO's worth of subsystems on top of it. There's no denying that it's unique, but does it work?The early systems certainly do. Diving has a whiff of roguelite about it since the things you'll encounter are slightly different with every round and you're forced to find most of your equipment in the water. The first biome mostly has your standard tropical fish that you'd expect from a glance at the game, but you'll find more interesting encounters as you go deeper. Although the diving gameplay is largely the same from start to finish, boss fights and one-off encounters shake things up occasionally. It does feel pointlessly restrictive that some of the boss fights can only be done on a specific day, especially since you're allowed as many retries as you want, but none of them are hard enough for that to be a huge issue. Outside of some tedious puzzle sections about 80% of the way through the game, the diving is consistently enjoyable.The restaurant is similarly mostly solid. There's almost no depth to it, but it's satisfying in the same way that old Flash-style time management games were. You pick some fish to use as sushi ingredients for the night and then spend the rest of your time running back and forth between customers and the kitchen to deliver their food or server them drinks. You can hire staff to be able to handle more guests or prepare sushi more quickly, but in either case you're really just spending money to make the game play itself faster. A very late side quest introduces a Cooking Mama-style minigame that I wish had been used more, and I'd also have liked to see decorations have any kind of discernible effect. Buying them feels very wasteful when they don't obviously do anything and the game constantly wants your money for more impactful items.The systems introduced later in the game are a mixed bag at best. Most of them fit a pattern of being basically fine, but not terribly fleshed out and collectively tedious. You'll have three different farms producing five different kinds of resources by the end of the game, but each of them basically amounts to spending money and then waiting to get the outputs. Any seahorses you catch can be used for racing, but that's just button mashing where you'll win easily as long as your stats are decent. Many of these systems are also extremely grindy. You can improve sushi recipes to boost their stats, for example, but doing this requires spending increasingly huge amounts of fish meat for each level. Similarly, prices to upgrade your farms or equipment escalate quickly and have many levels, so even with an efficient restaurant it can take quite a while before you're able to make relatively marginal improvements. And don't even get me started on the stealth level.",0.14017718715393135
"Posted: December 10, 2022Early Access ReviewI love this game, love it love it love it. But the accessibility is awful. The QTEs with the harpoon absolutely destroy my hands and give me RSI is no time flat. The lightning harpoon QTE goes so quickly I can't even read what I'm supposed to do before they disappear. The game would benefit from some more forgiving time windows and options that don't leave me in pain after playing.",0.07348484848484849
"Posted: July 6This is a great game and I would have given it a positive review, but one problem makes it unplayable for people like me. If you have any sort of carpal tunnel or hand/wrist issues, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. They force you to do button mashing quicktime events that require you to mash the button super fast. There are no accessibility options to change this and I physically cannot place this game without hurting myself.",-0.00437710437710438
"Posted: July 2EDIT: Devs have responded that they're working on it, so fingers crossed that this will be a recommend soon. Looking forward to this game.Each time you harpoon a fish you have to do a lame ""mash space as quickly as you can"" action. Not only is that boring, loud enough to wake sleeping family members, and unchallenging, but it's an accessibility issue. I have a physical limitation that makes it difficult and painful to rapidly smash a key.Looking at the forum, there's a ~30 page thread stretching back the better part of a year of similar complaints. It baffles that the devs haven't added the option of a different mini game, or at least a simple option to disable the button-mash one. The latter should be a very, very simple thing to implement.I'd love to play this, but that needs to change before I can. Fingers crossed, but not very hopeful given the radio silence to date.",-0.09365079365079365

"Posted: June 30I wanna be brief why I wouldn't recommend getting the game even though it's great in many aspects.While the game looks and sounds fantastic, the more I play the more I get the feeling that the developers just doesn't respect the time of the player. Every new mechanic (which you will get in an endless rapidfire stream) just tries to be take as long as you can barely tolerate.The best example for this a the frequent puzzle sections in the story sections. The game tells you without fail how to solve all new puzzle mechanics and then you just have complete them, which comes down to picking up rocks and slowy swim with them somewhere or pull something down a few meters. In the later parts you are also in nearly no danger because your airmeter is most of the time between 70 and 90 percent full when you find the next container with new air.The only danger in the game are some really annoying enemies, that do obnoxious amounts of damage, and bosses.Those are awesome for the most part (I even liked the mantis shrimp, even though the tip at the start of the battle will lead you away from the stuff you should really do) but having a cool bossbattle every few hours that you can't even repeat and than another 1-4 hours boring busywork is just soul crushing.If mintrocket would have concentrated more on making mechanics more fun and less on cramming as much of them in this game, I'm sure this would have been contender for game of the year for me.I will probably still finish the game and update the review, if anything big changes but for me right now it's a clear no for the recommendation. Not because the game is bad or to expensive but because it just wastes it's potential by wasting your time.",0.03894595303686213
"Posted: September 16A great time!Dives take place in a variable hole of limited breadth but plenty of depth, with deeper regions containing pricier but also more dangerous & resilient sea life. There's a real sense of adventure that comes with a limited oxygen capacity & fearsome aquatic life that can end your dive before it's really begun. While it's not a hard game, there's a real risk/reward to be had throughout the game when it comes to dangerous species like sharks, whose meat might be valuable, but at much higher potential cost. Utilizing the gold you make from selling your sushi is the key to upgrading your gear to go deeper, while also making sure you have enough to run the business. During the story you'll also unlock several items that'll make your trips more fun & open up new opportunities for you.The management side of things is enjoyable with enough layers to keep you invested, with more being unlocked as you progress through the campaign. There's hundreds of dishes & ingredients to be found & mastered, so making the most of what you have access to is important. Add to that fish farm & farm management later in the game, staffing concerns & more besides, you'll find there's plenty here to min-max if you're into that sort of thing.The cast is fun & expands nicely alongside minigames, collectathon side content, and a story that's charming despite being a little bit all over the place later on. The game is packed to the brim with references & nods to other games that I'll not spoil here, but they definitely hit the mark more often than not.It's not all good however. The game has some puzzle segments which aren't really puzzle segments as much as they are time wasters due to their ridiculous simplicity, but that still doesn't stop Dave telling you ""huh, maybe I should pull that lever"" - well, yes Dave, thanks for the tip. The final few acts of the game in general feel a bit scatterbrained & rushed, but they don't detract too much from the overall experience as you can fish/collect/cook as much as you want in the post-game anyway.Overall, while far from perfect, Dave the Diver's addicting gameplay loop, charming presentation & lovable cast make for an experience I won't be forgetting any time soon!",0.13497379813169286

"Posted: August 3I'm sorry but I have to agree with a lot of the negative comments that really appreciate the game - just as I do - but criticize the type of game it starts off and shifts to. The comfy early-game definitely wears off after some time.What starts out as a Stardew Valley with fishes quickly evolves to boss battles after boss battles with forced mini games that reward button mashing and tedious puzzles that are neither fun nor challenging.Although for some reason some boss battles are ruthless since enemies are large, have rapid dashes and damage you on touching you (so getting bit by a shark is equally damaging as touching his back fin).Also, a lot of quest interactions are forced and teleport you around without consent. For example you could be planning on getting ingredients and finishing a quest in one run but a lot of times a quest ends in you just getting teleported back to your boat with no way of knowing beforehand.This can easily be fixed by asking ""Are you ready to leave?"" in some way or form so you can finish looting or gatheting something in your vicinity.The first few hours were definitely the best, right now it's just getting more stressful and tedious.When I want to play a game to chill out, this will not be on the list any longer.While this review might seem negative, I do agree with the positive feedback this game has gotten.",-0.01297979797979797

"Posted: September 13The game was so fun at the start when I was just catching fish and running the restaurant but the devs try to make this game so boring for some reason. So many ""tasks"" that you have to complete are you just holding spacebar and carrying an object underwater from point A to point B, no challenge, no fun just tedium.There's an underwater fish people village that you visit early on and while that sounds really cool it is one of the most boring parts of the game. The villager quests are so boring and uninspired once again consisting of the same hold space here and move to here mechanics.A good example of the devs realizing how slow this game is yet doing nothing about it also happens in that village. In the underwater village you move so slowly and the village is massive, simply crossing across it is a 2 minute excursion. The devs must have realized that because they added a underwater taxi that you can ride only in that village, except it triggers a cut scene each time you summon it, it disappears whenever you go into any building and it uses that villages exclusive currency each time you summon it again. Thereby making even the fast travel slow and punishing.Can't wait for the sequel to this game where you manage a paint drying business.",-0.12307692307692307

"Posted: April 3Early Access ReviewTLDR; This game has a lot of charm. I feel as though there are flaws to the diving experience that make it difficult to enjoy at times, so I can't say that I recommend it at its current state.--- The restaurant aspect is quite fun; I wish it were more central to the gameplay! The process of growing your business is addictive, and I think this is where it shines. The animations for special guests, interactive food serving mechanics (like serving various drinks!); the only issue I have is that I wish it could be longer. Granted, I'm only two chapters in, and I understand that this game is meant to focus on the diving part.Unfortunately, to say that the restaurant part outshines the diving part is telling of the latter's flaws. I have a growing list of issues in my diving experience that is making it difficult to enjoy.- Scripted diving moments feel too disruptive. I might go down to focus on catching all kinds of fish as well as finishing up a fetch quest for a customer only to end up fighting a boss I did not expect. The rude interruptions of my expeditions (where after certain quests are complete, I'm forced to go back up to the boat and wait for the next day to fish again) is not fun.There was a countdown toward an event where I had to prepare a bunch of menu items of a specific kind (jellyfish), and when the day came, a quest regarding the sea people forced me to miss the opening of the restaurant. I thought I had missed the event as well and was upset. Fortunately, it did push to the next day, but this felt like a bug to me.- There should be an ability to reference other info besides quests while diving. I get that having a smartphone underwater is not realistic, but I feel like it's necessary to be able to access info on what fish you need to get (for certain menu items, for achievements). Or even like, where I could find certain fish? All of this is available on your phone and the restaurant, but not while you're diving? Just something to think about.- Diving controls feel really muddy to me. This issue is glaring especially during combat events; it just isn't fun to struggle because aiming is limited and you can't turn as quickly to avoid wide attacks. I wish that moving around felt more responsive, but it's too slow and limiting at its current state. I know that charms exist to boost certain stats, but in my opinion the difference is negligible.I am sure that time will either prove that the developers can create a more cohesive, enjoyable experience, or that this game is simply not for me. I really want to like this game, so my fingers are crossed.",0.07615373309817752
"Posted: May 18Early Access ReviewAs of the time of this review, I've played 18 hours in early access.Play this game. Early access has TONS of content, plenty of story, and loads of enjoyable things to discover. Every time I thought there couldn't be more, there was more. This game sincerely has every kind of mini-game you can imagine, and they're all delightfully, carefully, lovingly crafted.The characters are hilarious. A lot of them aren'tlikeable... but also, they still are, just because they're wild caricatures. Especially our weapons dealer, oh man. He's both the worst and best character at the same time. Meanwhile, no one is particularly nice to our sassy, relatable Dave, but relationships develop and mature.And let's not forget about the exquisitely rendered pixel art. The level of detail that's gone into the aesthetic of this game is top tier. It's especially impressive when you run into the larger sea creatures, like the whale, which comes across as absolutely majestic. I was constantly distracting myself by looking at the underwater landscapes, the beautiful, interesting fish, the flashing neon lights of the sushi bar, and the unfathomably wild, charmingly rendered cut scenes when one of the NPCs did an upgrade or some sort of action.So this game is about catching fish. But it's also about exploration, wonder, interpersonal relationships, ecological conservation, and more.

"Posted: August 26Product received for freeWhy have a game that centers around one gameplay loop, when you can have one that focuses on three different ones? It is an arduous task to make a compelling game on its own, but to have different styles of gameplay be both polished and engaging is nothing short of a feat. This is why developer MINTROCKET has to be commended for their work on Dave The Diver, the latest indie sensation that has taken the internet by storm.This is the secret ingredient of Dave The Diver. It is a simple game, but never simplistic. Every day is split into two diving sessions in the sea in the morning and one night of managing the restaurant and serving customers. The underwater exploration feels basic enough: use a hook to capture fish or a knife to kill them (as well as recover algae and other useful ingredients). However, after a while, Dave is given a rifle to defend himself from dangerous marine creatures, and then he discovers more guns with different purposes, and then he can upgrade them to add extra features to them, and so on.Read the full review here.[cultfollowing.co.uk]",0.021874999999999995

Don't look at the screenshots (it's probably too late if you're here), just dive right in, it's worth it!My wife and kids don't really know what games I'm playing, but they know about that one because I've been switching between my PC, Steam Deck and simply talking about the game for most of the last 7 days. It's that good! Can you imagine when it gets out of EA?!10/10Disclaimer: I DID NOT get a free copy of this game by the developer. I got it from another curator who resells/trades the games he gets. You could say I paid for the game, but the devs didn't get my money, so I think it's important that I leave a honest review to make up for that, and I promise to buy any future DLC.",0.1693783068783069

"Posted: July 4Dave the Diver is one of the best games that I've played this year. It manages to combine the silliness that I've only seen in the Yakuza series with the coziness of Stardew Valley. The game is the equivalent of the saying ""But wait there's more"", because just when you thought you saw everything that it has to offer, it hits you with a new mini-game twist that you never saw coming.The gameplay is simple yet addictive, making it perfect for a round of casual gaming. The controls allow you to navigate Dave through various obstacles and easily collect valuable items along the way. Below are some questions that will help you decide if this is the game for you!Do you want to dive underwater, fish, and hunt for rare items and weapons? /  You can do that!Do you want to run your very own Sushi restaurant with menu, specials, and chef battles? / You can do that!Do you want to improve your restaurant by using an app that suspiciously looks like Instagram? / You can and need to do that!Do you want to have a farm within arm's reach that allows you to produce fresh ingredients for your restaurant? / You can do that!Do you want to have your very own fish tank that you can outsource straight to your restaurant at any time? / You can do that!Do you want to play a plethora of mini-games featuring such classics as.... seahorse racing?!?! / I don't know why, but yes, you can do that!In conclusion, ""Dave the Diver"" delivers a delightful underwater adventure with its engaging story, beautiful visuals, great characters, and satisfying progression system. It's a game that's easy to pick up and play, but hard to ""put down"". I have been a victim of the cursed promise ""one more dive before I go to bed"" numerous times.",0.2325252525252525

"Posted: April 7Early Access ReviewI.  Love.  This.  Game.  I don't always have a lot of time to game, but this scratches farming, time management, restaurant, exploration itches.  It's not easy, but not too hard, which is wonderful because I can play it in short bursts of time without having to resort to cheating.  It's not too grindy.  It's relaxing, with it beautiful seas and fishes (until I get eaten by a shark... oops).   I love that it's a game inspired by a real person and a real story, because we're all stories in the end.  It's nerdy and clever and funny without being preachy or condescending (a refreshing breeze considering all the games that feel the need to preach/propagandise/scold you for some imagined wrong).  I've even learned stuff through the random info and happenings.I don't eat sushi and I think this game is fantastic.

"Posted: August 11There are a lot of worse games for the price, but honestly this did not do it for me. I found it to be pretty shallow, a compilation of redundant mini-games sewn together to push forward a story that was not particularly interesting. The restaurant management portion of the game play loop is essentially a coolmathgames premise with better graphics. The other side of the game loop is the fishing bit, and all that is is a gun and a harpoon, and both either do is point and click to kill fish and then you just pick them up to sell as sushi later. The gun-play and fishing are not fun, if anything they are annoying.The characters are silly and unique but they aren't worth following... there is one point in the game where a character gets a fleshed out backstory, and you figure this will keep up, but it turns out to be a one-off and not even relevant to the greater story. It isn't even brought up by that character ever again.By the end of it, the ending is super rushed and not particularly rewarding. It is like a bundle of ideas and game-play mechanics that were never actually fleshed out.Still, the visuals, music, and general vibe of it is endearing. I can understand people's excitement for this because it has a lot of charm.",0.016

The perfect balance between challanging and relaxing. 9.5 out of 10I couldn't sleep and was going through my e-mail and noticed this had just released. I really enjoyed the demo so I picked this up and thought I'd play for 20-30 mins, and then go back to bed. 5 hours later and I only stopped playing b/c I have to go run some errands. Otherwise I'd still be paying this gem of a rpg/cooking sim mash-up. I like how so far, even after 5 hours of playtime, I'm still unlocking new things and upgrading just about everything else. And even when it gets difficult, due mostly from being swarmed by OP fish and losing all your o2, I still want to play because it (almost) never feels cheap or overwhelming.

"Posted: July 9Again, missing a more neutral option for reviewing a game, because, even if I enjoyed some of the things that Dave the Diver has to offer, there are some design choices on it that have worn me out and finally make me abandon the game.Something very important to warn people thinking about getting the game: This is not a chill management sim. If I have to describe Dave the Diver, I would say that is basically a very linear Visual Novel that presents you a lot of mechanics one after the other very abruptly with a sometimes fun sometimes awful story.I insist on the ""not chill"" part because this is my main complaint about the game: It is constantly pushing you to do all the things the game wants you to do, without letting you rest or taking these requests at your own pace. Sometimes these request pile up and all of them are mandatory. If you fail to do a quest, it is game over and you need to restart it. There is no choice on Dave the Diver, it is just one thing after the other.And yes, the game tries to have a lot of different things to do: you fish, you attend the bar,you upgrade weapons and your diver outfit, there is the sea people, the fish farm, the rice and vegetable farm...a lot of things are added constantly so the game does not feel boring, but in the end all of those things are just chores: get 5 items to x person. Catch this one fish. Find this one person.Another point of friction for me is that, while playing, you feel like the devs thinks that the player is dumb. Every little new thing is explained,reexplained and then highlighted when you need to do this. If you pair this with the fact that you spent all your time in the game doing one chore after the other, the overall experience, except for few moments is that of a gigantic chore in which there is no space for the player.I tried to like it as it is, but I really thing that this game would benefit of a more slow pace and a bigger focus on the fish/shop loop which is the best part of it. But the constant interruptions so they can advance the plot and present you the 100th mechanic that won't matter after its presentation makes it somewhat tedious and frustrating.",-0.09460803689064562
"Posted: October 9I feel like this game was not confident enough in its core gameplay loop and added way too many random extraneous mechanics that detracted from the core gameplay. Add to that a plethora of loading screens, cutscenes, and repetitive minigames, and I felt like most of my time was spent NOT diving, and I felt like them trying to do everything made each individual feature less polished.Most of the story didn't really tie into the fishing loop of the game, fishing just happened to be a thing that you could do on the side while you did the story. Instead, they would give random, slow, 1off minigames, which to me felt like time I could have been spending fishing.In the lategame, you have so many management tabs that you have to jump between each day that the loading times really get in the way of actually playing the game.Even the boss fights which could use the normal swimming and shooting mechanics often forced in some boss specific mechanic, which made the bosses feel like more out of place minigames instead of an extension of the existing gameplay.And that's not even to say that the diving loop was a perfect gameplay experience either. Navigating the map was pretty slow, and that carries over into combat with aggressive fish, where Dave really struggles to get out of the way. Add to that the limited range of motion that Dave can aim in (he's underwater, why can't he shoot up, but he CAN swim up? the fish can attack up and down), and it's actually quite a hassle to dodge some enemies and shoot them back. I played this game on steam deck, and I was also noticing that the aiming on Dave's weapons felt way too precise for an analog stick, but that could be called a skill issue.Also this game is barely a roguelike. Major landmarks are always in the same place, and fish of the same type tend to be around the same landmarks, and are guaranteed to be there every dive outside of specific event fish. There also aren't many spawns of certain fish/resources, so you often would have to follow the same path to the same place for multiple dives in order to get enough resources for certain upgrades, it felt very boring and repetitive.There were also mechanics that did not feel very well fleshed out, I believe there are only 3 or 4 unique fish to night diving, which made the mechanic feel pretty not worth it, outside of times where there was a night specific boss, or you NEEDED a specific night fish to advance. The restaurant mechanic also got very repetitive, playing the exact same minigames over and over until you could get the right employee to automate that task for you. If you didn't have every task automated, it was a nightmare to try and keep up with whatever you had missing.Also, the cooking competition minigame was atrocious. You had no idea what inputs you were expected to do before each step, and some of them came up so quickly I missed perfect inputs just because I didn't know what I needed to do before the minigame started.I don't think the writing was anything to write home about either. There is 0 character development across the course of the game, and one of the characters in particular desperately needed some. Dave also started annoying me towards the end of the game, every few seconds the gameplay would pause so we could go into a cutscene for Dave to explain exactly what we needed to do.Finally, I felt like the UI and QoL was pretty weak in this game. If you accidentally put something in your menu, there is no way to undo without losing the mats. A lot of the menus are a pain to navigate, and once you DO find the right thing, you'll get a cutscene that plays every ingame DAY, not just on every boot. It felt extremely clunky and time consuming, was not a fan.Speaking of bad QoL, there were a few actions tied to my Y button, including using consumable items, so sometimes I'd try to capture a fish, only to accidentally waste my O2 tank instead.So overall, while I think the game had good parts, it felt extremely unfocused, and dragged a lot. There's a lot of potential for a good game here, and the art design is really good, but it felt like dev time was wasted adding more and more mechanics and minigames instead of really polishing up the core gameplay.",-0.0019906680620966357

The weapon upgrades may be too expensive for the player to actually use them during the main quest. Some qte mechanics could be perfected : I played on a french keyboard, meaning the layout is not qwerty. Still the game tells you to push keys that are not the one that are binded. Their engine can do many things and sometimes it feels some mechanics have been barely skimed over, while being too good to be exploited for such a short time.I would love way more content and another main quest, because that was a really enjoyable and memorable dive.",0.16884057971014493

Posted: July 2The kind of game that keeps me playing games. Every so often a game comes along that seems to get everything right. Dave the Diver is a game like this. I had no idea I wanted a diving / restaurant management sim so much until playing this. Simply amazing! I'll update more as I get further in the game.,0.07357142857142857
"Posted: July 9A Passion Project Executed PoorlyThe game starts with an intriguing concept: hunt your fish, and sell them in your sushi restaurant, which you will also manage. That's a fun and innovative idea, right? In a similar way to the game ""Ravenous Devils."" Let me begin by saying that they have executed the pixel art style perfectly in this game. This game's visuals are amazing. A cool aspect of the restaurant is the ambiance, which varies according to your needs, the amazing animations of the VIPs, cooking animations, hiring new people and training them to satisfy the restaurant's needs, and putting together the menu to suit each guest's tastes. I wish this side was the main part of the game. Because, In DAVE THE DIVER, the game's main focus is the diving part at 70 percent. I must say that managing the restaurant (%30) is way more fun. The diving part begins cool, as you find yourself in a colorful ocean, surrounded by hundreds of different kinds of fish to find and explore. You are accompanied by friendly dolphins and giant sharks to hunt while listening to enchanting aquatic, atmospheric music. This gets extremely tedious because it's the same music for 40+ hours. You hunt for your fish, then sell them at your restaurant throughout the night. It's a cool gameplay loop, isn't it? At the 10-hour mark, around when you discover the Sea Human Civilization, the game's charm breaks down. This is because that's when Dave the Diver becomes extremely repetitive and grindy.The game throws quests at you. The game introduces you to many characters, but none are truly interesting. None of them feel like genuine friends to you. Every character you meet gives you fetch quests, and you do them and get rewarded (with money, not that satisfying). The missions and how they are presented to the player are poorly designed.DAVE THE DIVERA Screenshot of DAVE THE DIVERBy:BearsonalI also didn't enjoy the micro-management farms inside this game because you can't manage anything. They are brainless work. They have been placed in the game to artificially lengthen the game time. Minigames are cool, though. Frequent QTEs are tiring. The diving part of the gameplay is very bland and does not feel right. The controls of Dave are not tight, making boss and miniboss battles a tank-versus-tank battle. If you have enough HP (oxygen), you can tank the enemy, spam your harpoon and easily kill the big buddy. There is literally no strategic element to the ""hunting"" section of the game. Enemy hitboxes and animations also are not synchronized, which makes combat frustrating at times, even though it's such a simple game at its core. There were some cool bosses, but they really didn't flow with Dave's controls most of the time. Forced stealth missions feel very out of place in Dave The Diver, because stealth is not fun or engaging in this game.The main story is decent. It evolves into a mystery story that I won't spoil. It can be interesting at times. There are tons of boring and unskippable dialogue and cutscenes. Thus the game makes you feel ""not in control"" so often. They should have given us full freedom and control, like in Outer Wilds, for example.So Dave the Diver is this year's trending indie game, a better selection than that cat game, for sure. However, a curious thing I have noticed is that almost every positive review has logged 5-10 hours of gameplay max. This is a characteristic of casual players these days. People enjoy a game for a few hours, then bam! Positive reviews. What about how that game will present itself to you in the last 90 percent? Will it be worth your time? Can the game keep the experience fresh for the players? They don't care about that stuff. But I am proud to say I do. I have never reviewed a game without finishing it, and I don't intend to start now. I've played this game for 50 hours now, completed its main story, and have seen almost everything it has to offer. I honestly can't see where all the excitement comes from. To conclude, Is Dave the Diver an awful game? No. Is it a masterpiece? Absolutely not.BRONZE MEDALFollow My Curator Page:https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/",0.021473481167358723

"Posted: September 23Starts off as a very fun game but at some point it randomly decides to become a visual novel, replacing the enjoyable gameplay with an endless array of cutscenes followed by brief 2 minute segments of trivial puzzles and quick-time events; the interesting exploration and cool boss fights of the first half simply disappear, replaced by a linear series of corridors for you to trudge through, every new room complete with a relatively simple puzzle that the game nonetheless pauses and explains to you. It is is also joylessly stretched out by forcing you to return to town and get a mcguffin every few puzzles, so you don't blow through it all in one go.For some reason, around this time you also start unlocking a lot of random mini-games and activities to do.

"Posted: July 10It's an interesting game.  I *want* to like it quite a lot.  It's got a great atmosphere, beautiful graphics, and the core gameplay loop has a phenomenal amount of work put into it and is honestly very fun.  Every character design (somehow even Duff) oozes charm and care, and the sound effects and music are engaging and haven't grown old even a bit.But it has a lot of small mechanical issues that add up and in a few cases enough questionable design choices, all small ones admittedly, that have made the last few hours of trying to enjoy it a chore, and I can't say I'd want to play it further at this point.First off, the game continually throws more and more at you, but the pacing is inconsistent and oftentimes it throws enough at you at once that it's difficult to manage.Second, the gun/harpoon-aiming system is an honest pain to use.  There is an inexplicable limit to your aiming angle and despite being underwater, Dave is apparently incapable of pointing his guns up or down.  Furthermore, you have to press down the right mouse button and then aim, then left click to fire.  On its own this isn't bad, except that ANYTHING, including firing the gun/harpoon, ejects you from the 'aiming' state.  And due to the animation timings, this means that you are effectively stunlocked out of being able to use your gun for one or two seconds, plus however long it takes you to leave and re-enter the aiming state.  If you forget to leave and re-enter aiming, instead Dave will whiff his melee weapon like a fool.Third, there are inexplicable difficulty bumps in random places.  Shortly after the tuna event, another special event started (This time without fanfare, just a notification icon in the corner), and as part of it it seemed like much stronger enemies began spawning in areas that, until that point, had been completely low-level and easy to navigate.  Including one variant of shark that could kill Dave (with a 280-odd-bar oxygen tank) in 4-5 hits, and which moved multiple times as fast as Dave meaning it was impossible to avoid and tanked far more damage than my upgraded gun could deliver.  Combat in general is plodding and a pain; you have limited manoeuvrability and oftentimes you will get stunlocked/mauled by one or more animals at once, sometimes by surprise, with literally no option other than to try and close the game before it autosaves.To further make combat a pain, the ability to non-lethally manage fish is severely limited.  The hush gun is laughably impotent against anything remotely threatening, and the game itself is so amazingly stingy with net traps that it is a lottery gamble to see if you ever even manage to have the tools you need to complete some objectives effectively.  This, of course, assuming random bad luck doesn't simply negate your run, cost you any decent equipment you tried to buy to work with, and cost you time that you can't get back.  The game seriously needs a way to upgrade your defensive/damage-reduction factor (charms have not been sufficient thus far), or to calm down combat for people who want to enjoy the more enjoyable parts of the game.There is also some inconsistency with the harpoon QTEs with timing limits and ease, and in general it feels like the game's accessibility is limited especially with the razor-thin reaction times you actually have to work Dave's hitboxes out of the way of incoming attacks, given how slow he is even at maximum speed.It's probably a game still worth supporting, and it's a huge amount of promise, but there are definitely gotchas and the game has gone from fun to frustrating enough that for the time being I can't recommend it.",0.027194616977225684
"Posted: June 29ill be upfront and say i havn't beaten the game as of me writing this review, but its hands down one of the best games iv'e played as of recent.both calming and intuitive with how the game is played shows some real dedicated professionals put serious love into the development. ill start with the calming factor of the gamethe games ""feel"" is peaceful but under the surface has some really interesting encounters, in the aftermath of your dives you have access to a sushi bar to show some well earned progression.the intuitive flow of gameplay to progression is amazing, occasional grind if needed, story flows well with what you earn and overall gameplay is the best ive seen for the genrenow, the combat is... uniquethe combat is a good portion of positioning due to only being able to shoot on a 180 degree both to the left and right. and movement from enemies way's of attacking, i wont go too far into it as its a learned thingthe combat mechanic's works in an interesting flow of wound and capture, or wound and kill, or my favourite, QTEwound and capture works for anything that cant be captured with a single harpoon shot relying on foresightwound and kill is exactly what it sounds like but is actually the last thing you want to do normally in this game but cant be avoided with certain fishnow, the QTE's. THEY ARE NOT ANNOYING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ITS A MIRACLE!!!the QTE's only appear when harpooning a weak fish that doesn't guarantee a capture, now heres the cool part, the QTE's vary depending on the harpoon tip (dont worry you'll figure it out maybe an hour in) and make it genuinely interesting to capture fish.overall my personal experience with the game so far has been amazing. if you are longing for a game that doesnt have microtransactions, a horrid grind, and greed written all over it then pick this game up, the price is (in my opinion) amazing for what you are given.hope this essay of a review was good enough to give a summaryEDIT: OH YEA, i forgot to mention, a good portion of this game can also be played on one hand. only place you really can't is combat related BUT STILL THATS DOPE!",0.13624338624338622

"Posted: July 16This game is a masterpiece!In my opinion, the whole game is quite successful almost throughout.Lots of different tasks, very good animations, Easter Eggs, varied gameplay, good music etc. The game does so many things right.Positives+Story: It's definitely good, but it also feels pretty standard in parts. 8/10+Sounds/Soundtracks: Are very well done. There is a variety of music that perfectly fits the different moments. 9/10+Details: There are so many small details and Easter Eggs from other games or even inspired by real people are very successfully incorporated with the characteristics belonging to the characters. 9.5/10+Animations: With the gameplay, the strongest thing about the game. There are a lot of animations that were made with a lot of love and just fit perfectly to the game. 10/10+Gameplay: The variety is extreme in this game. The days are rarely monotonous and you are often confronted with new tasks that use different game mechanics and also fit very well into the game. 10/10Negatives- The only criticism I have are the bosses, where all are very good but the balance is sometimes strange. Some bosses at the beginning are harder than those that come later, a boss in the middle of the game is extremely hard, in my opinion harder than the final boss.- And the beluga you can use later outside the story feels a bit unnecessary, especially when you have to pay for it.ConclusionI am very happy to have come across the game through the Steam Store page and can recommend it to everyone, even if the graphic style does not appeal to everyone at first.For me, DAVE THE DIVER is currently the best game that came out this year.9/10",0.12758698092031423
"Posted: July 7Well, let's review this little gem, shall we ? I'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible.- Visuals -Dave The Diver uses an unusual mix of 3D and pixel art, and the low res textures on the 3D bits make the two mesh surprisingly well. This makes the fish species easy to tell apart (which is pretty impressive considering the sheer number of them) and the environments just gorgeous while still looking pixel art-y.The pixel art is absolutely beautiful and very well animated, both for the gameplay sprites and the larger pictures such as character portraits. The cinematics are just excellent, you can tell the artists were having a lot of fun.- Audio -The soundtrack is extremely fitting to the chill ambiance of the game. The only minor gripe I have with it is that some tracks get repetitive after 40 hours of gameplay, maybe they will add some alternate tracks in the future.There is no voice acting but the sound design gives a very distinct voice to every character. The other in-game sounds are also pretty solid.- Gameplay -The game manages to strike an excellent balance between letting the player explore at their leisure and introducing new mechanics. Even after 30 hours there are still some new, small mechanics added, keeping the gameplay fresh. Which I suppose is fitting for a game about fish.The main gameplay loop is split between the diving phase and the surface phase. During the diving loop, you explore the depths, catch fish, find loot... all while having to manage your dwindlingHPOxygen bar and your inventory weight. The swimming is very smooth and easy to get used to, and again new, small mechanics are added to fishing and exploration the deeper you go - such as weaponry, equipment upgrades, small QTEs when harpooning uncooperative fish, etc. While some of the aquatic wildlife is aggressive, most of it will just run away from you so again, exploring is very chill.The surface phase is about managing the sushi restaurant, which uses the fish you caught. Pretty straightforward, right ? Well, again, it starts simple and gains extra mechanics as you get further into the game. First it's pretty much the chef and you. You set the menu for the evening, the chef makes the food and you serve it to the customers. But as business grows, you'll need more staff, then new ingredients. Then you get special events with a batch of customers who will pay extra for a certain kind of sushi... Yet all of it manages to stick together and form a very organic whole.The one nitpick I have is that the underwater puzzles are pretty simple, and Dave has a tendency to spoil the solutions by thinking aloud. Also, playable tutorials for stuff like pouring beer would be nice.- Writing -The story is pretty good, but what really stands out is the characters. They are very well written, and very well served by both the animation and sound design here. You can hear the fire in usually reserved Bancho's voice when he starts talking about cooking. You can hear the excitement in Dr. Bacon's voice when Dave comes back to the surface with good news. The characters are just the right mix of mundane and cartoonish to come together as memorable. A special note to Dave, for managing to be an overweight protagonist whilenotbeing the butt of cheap fat jokes. Also, before you ask, no you cannot ""accidentally"" lodge a harpoon inSuwam's hindquarters.The game itself also have an excellent sense of humor, with references to other games peppered in every other corner. You can even get famous streamers and copyright-friendly characters as staff members.- Final thoughts -I have a bad habit of focusing on the negative. Yet if I'm being honest, the only negatives I could find here are nitpicks. I only have good things to say about Dave The Diver. It is beautiful, fun, memorable, and it deserves a place in the indie hall of fame with the likes of Stardew Valley. An excellent game if you just want to relax and catch fish.10/10",0.20499609497032176
"Posted: July 28I never leave reviews for Steam games, ever. I just finished this game and I want to cry, it is so cute and wholesome and beautiful. The gameplay is so addictive, it's varied and never gets stale, I seriously sat down and played for 38 hours hardly putting it down. Buy this game, it's perfect.",0.010353535353535347
"Posted: July 3This is a very excellent game that came as a complete surprise to me and my friends. I'm not a fan of restaurant management games, nor do I have any interest in diving/the deep ocean (thanks, thalassaphobia). But this game got its hooks into me and wouldn't let go for two straight days.I haven't beaten it yet, but I believe I will in the next 3-4 hours.So, what is it about this game that won me over? Well, not the first hour, that's for sure. I was downright bored initially. Every in-game day starts with your character jumping off their boat into the ocean (usually), and thus begins your diving adventure for the day. You swim around while managing an oxygen meter (which doubles as your health -- getting hit by hostile fish/environmental hazards drains your oxygen, and when that runs out... you ded), and your goal is to slaughter and collect valuable fish to bring back to your sushi restaurant after your diving trip is done. This was a cute little dynamic, but I knew there was no way it would keep me interested for more than a couple hours.Fortunately, Dave the Diver agrees -- and that's why it doesn't rely on that gameplay loop to keep players engaged.Dave the Diver's strength lies in its ability to constantly surprise you. Have you played games like Breath of the Wild? Games where you're constantly learning about new systems and features, and ways to interact with the game world? Dave the Diver offers a similar experience.The game will shift and morph before your very eyes constantly. Make sure you do your main story and side quests, and you'll find that entirely new gameplay systems are revealed to you at regular intervals: farming, fish breeding, seahorse racing, restaurant automation, trading card collecting, roguelike gameplay progression (with permanent unlockable upgrades), weapon crafting, exciting new boss fights and creatures... There are so many mechanics and interlocking systems in this game that I genuinely struggle to name them all. And only a handful of the unique ones were mentioned above.As you progress, you will feel a sense of wonder and discovery that's rare in games these days.And how can I forget the amazing art direction and character designs? Dave the Diver's characters are silly and fun, and every character has a certain level of charm. Even the ones you might hate at first will probably start to grow on you the more you interact with them. And Dave himself is not a silent, personality-less protagonist. He's a big, wholesome teddy bear that cares about his friends and those in danger, and that's reflected in his dialogue as well as his animations.The last major positive that comes to mind is the game's custom, full-screen pixel art animated cutscenes. These are beautifully-created sequences that play for actions ranging from the mundane to the exceptional -- they are not just reserved for major story moments. The simply act of researching new dishes or completing a fetch quest will reward you with one of these gorgeous scenes, and many of them will probably have you laughing out loud or spamming your screenshot key. Some scenes do eventually repeat for certain actions (like researching new dishes), but there's still a lot of variety here. It's almost worth playing the game just to experience those cutscenes.I don't often leave reviews for games, but I strongly recommend Dave the Diver. If you're like me and you don't find the core gameplay loop compelling initially, that's fine! Keep going anyway. Focus on your non-repeatable quests. Unlock more content and systems. Give this game a chance to surprise and delight you, and it will absolutely rise to the challenge.Thanks, devs. I can't wait to see what you make next.",0.10224994303941673
"Posted: June 30Hilariously, my first comparison for Dave the Diver were the old Jumpstart games. To be clear, this game appears to have no intention of teaching you anything. But where it is similar is that those old educational games built a universe for you to explore and then packed them with mini-games and they would use a storyline to guide you from game to game. This style of game has died off in recent years and I completely forgot how chill it is. Dave the Diver is adult Jumpstart without the learning.The game is amazing in every way so far. I love running the sushi restaurant, diving and exploring the ocean is a blast, collecting new fish, upgrading my equipment, unlocking new weapons... Everything in this game is well thought out and rewarding to progress. I have also been loving the music.This game is worth every cent they ask for.",0.0446969696969697
"Posted: July 1Instead of ""just one more turn"", this game features ""just one more dive"". And it may even be more addicting. At first it is just a chill and relaxing diving game, with some hectic sushi bar serving during the evening, but the more you play, the more it opens up. Never getting too complex, it introduces more and more game mechanics, that I didn't expect from this game at all. The only con are some of the quick action mechanics, that disturb the chill diving.Pros:- great (and surprising) story and storytelling- relaxing dives in a beautiful 2D pixel word- hilarious characters- lots of sushi- quite a lot of boss fights with different mechanics (some are also a bit hard, needed 2-3 tries on at least 2 bosses)- more gameplay than you might expect (38h in, not finished with the story and still soooo much stuff to do)Cons:- some of the quick action button mashing doesn't fit too well with the otherwise relaxing game- the theme is a bit hard when you know that sharks aren't as evil and aggressive as they are shown here and fishing in general is a complicated story (mini spoiler:doesn't help, that the eco activist are portrayed as the evil guys",0.08095238095238094
"Posted: June 30For the last few decades, I've been buying game after game, trying to find something that gives me the same joy I had when I was playing games when I was younger and more carefree. More often than not, while fun for a little while, they fall to the side, either to repetitive, to easy, to hard, to whatever.Dave the Diver gives me joy.Other reviews are going to say the same thing, because it's true. Somehow they made a gameplay loop that includes elements that all seem like they ""should"" be frustrating...because they would be in any other game. After thinking about it for a while, I believe I know why this game is great: they somehow made it so that even if you ""fail"", you aren't punished for it. Perhaps this changes later on, but right now it feels like I'm always progressing, even if something goes wrong.",0.013120039682539686

Posted: July 5Such a great game. I hope new DLC's comes out.,0.1787878787878788
"Posted: July 5tldr: This is one of those games where it starts off VERY promising and it just gets worse the further you get. Almost like the Demo was to bait people in then cram all the crappy stuff outside it. This game does not value your time or RSI.After putting 30+ hours into the game, I can't recommend this game for someone looking for a 'complete package' experience for a game that has A LOT of problems the further you progress the story. It is full of a lot of frustrations that just aren't worth the hassle.On the surface this game is quite enjoyable and fun. It boasts a lot of progression systems that are rather well designed; from running a restaurant, gathering resources, operating farms, gear upgrades. It looked and played very well.So why the negative review? Because the negative parts of this game just leave a horrible experience of waiting to get back to the good stuff and most of them are mandatory to get through or just mundane crap for no reason. It feels like the developers had too many ideas and tried to add them all instead of refining the good ones.So, some of the negatives that turn this game from quite good to a pretty bad experience.-Quick Time Events: There are so many QTE's in this game it should come with a health safety rating for your hands. It puts Path of Exile's flask piano mashing to shame. Seriously if you have RSI or value the health of your hand/wrists/fingers, I would advise to not play this game until they add accessibility options. It's that bad.Suggestion to the above problem; Either add accessibility options or allow upgrading/charms to eventually remove some of the tediousness that is the QTE's.-Bosses: most people probably think boss fights would be a fun and cool experience and in any other game you'd be right. However, in Dave the Diver, the vast majority(90%) of them just suck; from taking damage during times where you have ZERO control of your character(cut-scene, scene transitions), to unintuitive mechanics and hitboxes. Most of these are mandatory and force you to complete them to get back to the good part. There are a few bosses that are actually good.-Health and Oxygen being the same resource: This is like making Stamina and Health the same resource in Dark Souls, just a poorly executed idea. Big enemies and bosses can sit on you and the only way to get away is to 'boost' which consumes Oxygen(which is your HP) which makes you die faster, but all the large enemies have a dash that can very easily get them back ontop you of.-Hitboxes: I can't count the amount of times I have gotten hit by an animation that has yet to touch my character because the larger enemies have weird tails and animations that cause them to be bigger then they seem.-Game Over mechanic: When you die(mostly due to out of your control crap listed above) you get a game over that sends you back to the boat and you get to keep ONE item. Sometimes you spend 15-20 minutes underwater collecting and exploring only to die to something you had very little control over. You just wasted 20 minutes only to gain a single item. The solution is to alt f4 and save scum so you get that section of the day back.Suggestion to the above problem: A charm or an upgrade path could allow you to take more items upon a game over.Edit#1 - Removed feedback/negativity on the Stealth mission as checkpoints were added making it less frustrating.Edit#2- Finished the game after 40 hours. Still a lot of charm to the game, still a few things listed above which are still a bit frustrating.",-0.044549529688418577
"Posted: January 19Early Access ReviewGreatly recommend it, even at this stage where the current content on early access has about 12-15 hours of content i hugely recommend it as there is a lot to do! keep in mind that is early access and you will get a wait for full release to continue the story mid way but the current content has a lot to keep you busy and it is worth the price 100%For the good- The artstyle is amazing! Lots of animations and lots of tiny details that give the game so much life- A lot of diversity on fish and dishes for the sushi restaurant (Also for each new dish you serve you get some more art as the form of a social media post in-game)- The music is pretty good and i gotta say i never got tired of hearing it- Pretty much each section has a lot to do from ways to catch the fish to increase the card quality to customizing the store look or hiring/training new staffThere's also a fish farm where you can get more fish for the sushi bar or just to watch your fish like it was an aquarium AND there's also an actual farm where you get to grow rice and vegetables for the sushi bar- Each new character you meet has some very distinguish personality and animations to themThis depends on the person playing it to find it either good or bad- There isway too much to doand you have no downtime between content, some people might find it good that you can just continue the story but for some other you might find it overwhelming to see the to-do list always there for what you have to do next (Maybe some days between some events so you can focus on fish collection and improving the sushi bar)-QTEAll weapons and some bosses/big fish have some way of QTE (All different from each other) and while it provides some fun for some it might be tiresome to mash spacebar or try to figure out the QTE and failing a lot, i got used to it quickly and i actually liked it but if you could change the keybinds it would improve a lotNow for the bad- The bosses are way too easy (at least in my opinion)- Quality of the fish does nothing other than give you the golden card- No way of changing the keybinds-A LOTof spacebar mashing- Upgrading the food does absolutely nothing on some dishes as there are way easier ways to get the big money big taste comboyou can abuse this even more with the fish farmand just spam those, getting some bonus or more upgrades to dishes so you have to give variety would be great- Once you get a tv ad and upgrade some employees there's nothing more to do on the staff side and you just watch the money grow and i find it bad since you can do this very early game, need more bar interaction or some ways of expanding since the bar is pretty much half the gameOverall the game is great and the overwhelmingly positive is well deserved, even with the bad things i posted i loved the game 100% and had great 12~hours of pure enjoyment, i'm hyped and cant wait for what the next updates bring.",0.15207436841765204

"Posted: November 3, 2022Early Access ReviewI don't normally go for Early Access games anymore.  I would say around 90% of them that I've played have been utterly disappointing.This is not one of those games.What a lovely blend of early console underwater side-scrolling games (like Jaws on NES or Ecco the Dolphin on Genesis) and food serving games (like Cook, Serve, Delicious).  The game itself is a simple concept: Dive to catch fish during the day, make your fish into sushi and run your restaurant at night.On top of this, there are a lot of crafting aspects such as making/upgrading your gear and weapons, exploration of a randomly-generated ocean each time you dive, and customization of your restaurant.  The best part?  All of your tasks for the day/night only take a few minutes, so you aren't stuck doing any one thing for a long period of time.  The game gradually increases in difficulty as well as rewards, and there are plenty of things to keep you busy.This dialogue is very cute and tongue-in-cheek, and is one of the few games where I've actually enjoyed reading through it.I can tell this game will be keeping me busy for quite some time, and I can't wait to see where it goes.  Definitely worth the early access price.",0.15227272727272728
"Posted: July 2Outstanding, quite possibly my GOTY for this year. Very satisfying game made with a lot of love and charm.The game loop has three stages: In the first stage, you dive into the ocean, catch fish, and hunt for resources and treasures. In the second stage, you prepare your menu and ingredients from the fish you've caught. And the third stage is a frantic series of minigames as you manage the night's business in the sushi restaurant.Every part of this game is fun and satisfying to play, and the little cutscene rewards for things like upgrading a recipe or unlocking a new one are lovely. Blowing a VIP customer's mind and seeing their cutscenes is a big delight too, very shades of ""God of Cookery"".I have only one significant complaint about the game so far: The gameplay loop gets interrupted CONSTANTLY by special missions and more complexity that rolls out. The game really needs to let me, as a player, just go have a calm chill fishing trip sometimes. It feels like 75% of the first dives in the game you'll make will get interrupted by MORE CONTENT which, sure, great, but... the baseline game is good enough, let us sink into it more. The pacing just feels too fast early on.Anyway, it's a great game, and I'm loving it. I hope you will too.",0.1532751623376623
"Posted: August 11An amazingly fun game.With a ton of mechanics, freedom and ¿collectible fishes?Things that I liked the most:-The Pixel art. That's all, incredible animations and beautiful art without any flaws.-The music and SFX. Be it ambiental music, fighting music or the SFX, it is good and the best is that it doesn't feel repetitive ata any point of the game.-Bancho.Things that I think that could improve or small bugs:- Bug: After arriving to 1,112 likes in Cooksta it stopped growing.Every night after archiving that number when the report shows up it also shows how I have a smaller number and it grows repeatedly to 1,112.For example: Previous count = 1,112 -> Report -> 33 New Likes + 1,079 -> 1,112 every night.- I don't know if this was intended, but, In the Glacier Passage you get kicked out of the room before taking a photo of the mural, In order to get all of the ""Sea People"" murals photos you have to return and remake the puzzle and all of this can be quite annoying, even more if you don't remember which mural you are missing.- I found that after the credits, you don't have anything to do, everything starts to feel lifeless quite fast.I think that adding some endgame missions, characters, or some new features (more dreams, the posibility to refight bosses maybe, somehow going back to the past...) would do a lot of good.In conclusion.A fun game that throws a new mechanic or minigame that you have never seen every 3h of game (aprox), with an incredible art, animations and ambientation, with a simple but engaging history and some interesting characters.I'd rate it with a8 / 10on my personal scale that nobody cares for.Don't drown.",0.1904601571268238

"Posted: July 21Contrary to the game's marketing, and what the first few hours of the game had me believe, the exploration and management aspects of this game are underdeveloped. After about 10 hours it became clear that this game is actually a story-driven action RPG with a bunch of tacked-on minigames, and as an RPG it's not even particularly good. There's lots of ""go fetch this MacGuffin and defeat the boss that ambushes you when you pick it up"". Well, not quite, there is some variety in ""try to fetch MacGuffin #1, find out you need MacGuffin #2, but MacGuffin #2 is locked behind some other quest progression, so complete that first"".The boss fights are tedious and rely heavily on the played-out ""dodge the attack animation, shoot the soft underbelly that appears briefly, repeat until victory"" mechanic. The defeat of each boss provided little sense of accomplishment and more a feeling of relief that it was over. The ambushes are all predictable, but the devs have written Dave to be completely unsuspecting of them, leading to some eye-rolling moments such as one boss fight where you enter the boss zone via a ""dangerous creature ahead"" prompt, but then Dave says something to the effect of ""Good thing this place is uninhabited!"" Later parts of the game world introduce some environmental puzzles, but they're very easy to solve and felt like filler. The biggest challenge I had was trying to figure out what some QTEs were asking me to actually do.The Blue Hole is very pretty, but it's small and despite the ""ever-changing"" label in the marketing, it hardly changes at all. The ""Rogue-like elements"" are so minimal as to barely be detectable. The sushi restaurant management gameplay is a fun hook at first, but it turns out to be fairly shallow. After progressing in the Cooksta rating system, it becomes purely a profit min-maxing enterprise. On top of that, the farming mechanics introduced later in the game feel more like tedious obligations rather than an enhancement to the gameplay loop. The other minigames are rather boring and didn't compel me to play again after the game forces you to try them for the first time.Some other relatively minor complaints I have: combat controls are a little janky with the gun activation button being inconsistently responsive and the aim jumping after the activation animation completes. There are forced dialogue portions during the sushi game where you waste precious time by being frozen while the game clock continues running. The game does not fill the screen of an ultra-wide monitor.

"Posted: March 12Early Access ReviewI first knew about this game from a virtual youtuber called Amoria streaming it, and it looks interesting enough that I decided to buy it afterwards. The idea of combining a sushi bar management with deep sea exploration with a side of combat doesn't sound like it would work, but somehow it worked out very well. The core gameplay loop of harvesting fish and marine animals for the sushi bar, then making money to improve your gear so that you can harvest better fish is a solid one, and the pixel art aesthetics is something that I appreciate. I have cleared most content that the early access has to offer, and I can't wait for the full game to be released!If I have to nitpick, I would prefer if there is a bulk dispatch function for the staff. Having to select them individually quickly become tedious once you have too many staff in the waiting room with nothing better to do. It might be a good idea to mark timed quests as such if there are more in the full game.",0.18106060606060603

"Posted: July 8Overall Score[9/10]Dave the Diver is a deep, addictive game about diving, catching fish and running a sushi restaurant. The premise alone is enough to warrant giving it a try, but what they've done here is so well made that it's definitely going to be a top contender for many people's indie game of the year. So far it's mine!The diving aspect of the game is really fun, only starting to feel tedious in the later portions of the game, where each dive can last up to 15-20min depending on your goals. The restaurant management aspect was always fun and just deep enough that it stayed engaging without being too micro-managey. The game has a great sense of charm, with hugely entertaining little cutscenes and visual gags scattered throughout the 'day-to-day' challenges of running the restaurant that had me cracking up often.If you're looking for something different, fun and great value for your money- check this instant classic out- you won't regret it!Gameplay[9/10]Graphics[9/10]Audio[8/10]Stability/Performance[10/10]Narrative[7/10]‘Special Sauce’[10/10]",0.08636204481792717

"Posted: July 8TLDR: 9.5/10. Addicting, beautiful, funny and super enjoyable for a sea diving + sushi bar management game! And oh boy there's more than just that!Dave The Diver has got to be one of the biggest indie surprises for me along with Pizza Tower and let me tell ya I never thought you could make diving and sushi selling addicting and fun. The game is basically you playing As Dave that explores the deep sea ocean and whatever you caught can be sold to you at your own sushi bar for profit. Easy loop on the surface but dive deepernot sorryinto the game mechanics and it becomes much more interesting and varied. There's a whole lotta diversed mini-games as well which 90% of them are fun and boss fights and unique events that keeps you on your toes. Seriously I have over 30+ hours in this game, the game is packed with CONTENT especially the quest diversity. Very plentiful of things to do for a scuba diving game.Absolutely one of my favourite part about this game is the cutscenes/characters. Sure the characters are a bit straightforward and quirky funny but the cutscenes REALLY amplifies the scenes. Tasting the food like Anton Ego in Ratatouille, story moments, looking at photos of your achievements and even freaking UPGRADING YOUR WEAPON. That one is hands down the best and got me laughing. The graphics are also a beautiful blend of 2D pixel art sprites with 3D aquatic life and background which is just astounding. Especially with the music giving that sense of undersea depth from haunting to peaceful and magical. Props to the composer!I don't have much downsides but I do have maybe a nitpick with 2 issues. One is some of the QTEs can be a bit unnecessary or not telegraphed well especially in a boss fight. The 2nd one would probably just be that one section where you're sneaking which I kinda didn't like. That's just me though but it bugged me.Overall, even at full price it's worth your bucks. Vast and addicting variety of content with the most personality of cutscenes I've ever seen (props to whoever animated the cutscenes when you enhance your sushi). You'll get a laugh, you'll get a bit scared, probably laugh and smile more after that. I guarantee you it's worth deep diving into as it is as deep as it sounds. ( Ok I'll stop with the diving puns )Oh and you can feed cats and pet sea animals in the game too. And raise your own Tamagotchi.",0.19866255144032927

"Posted: October 8Dave The Diver is a great combination of the ""cozy game"" genre, perfect for relief in stressful periods of life. While it seems like there isn't much to it, when you just sratch the surface, the game keeps on giving. It has a story, quirky and adorable characters, a nice sense of humour, challenge, should you impose it on yourself, and whenever I thought I've seen it all, it reveals more and more content even past the end of the storyline, as if it's trying to do everything out there. But all the genres mix naturally, and usually you can skip an activity you don't particularly like entireyl.All this in a beatiful, meticulously crafted pixel art, and some of the best fullscreen cutscenes, which there are a ton of, and they almost always put a smile on my face.So far, I think this is the ultimate ""cozy"" game.10 stars!",0.20083333333333334
"Posted: July 13Didn't expect it to bethisgood! I'm usually sceptical about games trying too hard to look ""retro"" with pixelated graphics and all.. but this one is actually brillantly executed! Not only the pixel art is high-res and nicely animated (kudos to the short curscenes, they're both amazing and hillarious :D), but the ocean part in 2.5D is pretty too and works well with the pixelated textures. It mixes both graphic styles perfectly.Then i was also assuming the game would entertain me a few hours then i'd move on to something else. I was wrong there also! The exploration is the main part of it, but managing the sushi restaurant, trying to get better and upgrading your equipment is surprisingly easy and addictive. It could have been enough, but the story takes you to many places and gives each dive a purpose. The best part is that the game is not forcing you and let you do the objectives at your own pace, even if you take days!So yeah, a very enjoyable casual game with lots of things to do, mini games, a story, lots of exploration and some action ! ... and one last amazing thing worth mentionning: It run smoothly on a crappy computer with an integrated GPU, which means it's intelligently coded.",0.1760752688172043

I know that there are plenty of high quality indie games on the market, but this one is one of the best in my opinion.The game's idea, diving for fish, serving the fish in a restaurant, to get money for better gear, to catch better fish, to sell for more money -- is nothing new. Pretty Tycoon-y.But the uniqueness of this game is why I appreciate it so much. It's beautiful, even though its only pixels. The soundtrack is amazing, and the dialogue in game is pretty funny so far.It's not GOTY or anything, but it is a VERY solid title for $20. I'd highly suggest picking this game up for little bursts of playtime.I enjoy booting the game up, doing a couple day's worth of fishing and serving, then when the game saves, I close it.It's very casual, very little commitment, and you can play it with the sound off.

(Farming, Fishing, Sushi Restaurant, Fish Farm, Tamagotchi, etc.)The way everything is tracked and managed through the cellphone apps is perfect. The cellphone notification system makes it easy to make sure you don't miss anything without being too 'in-your-face'.Sound, character, and gameplay design are all incredible. Art style really bridges the gap between 2D and 3D in a beautiful way. Boss-battles are fun, engaging, and occasionally difficult, but always allow for retries without losing your loot. Great game to play casually, or spend an entire night grinding.Only thing this game is missing is co-op, but it's still fun to hop into disc with a few friends and play in tandem.

"Posted: July 23I love this game 9/10.It is an excellent chill business grinding game like Recettear or Stardew Valley. Each has management element and an action element and Dave the Diver's action element blows those legendary games out of the water. All while having a similarly charming and fun management element on par with Rec and Stardew. My only gripes are little nitpicks about the way that the management element fails to automate tedious tasks and is more complicated than necessary.=Everything below this point is the little things that I think make the overall game fall short of perfection=FARMINGThe normal farm is expensive to scale up. I beat the final boss on day 33 and didn't manage to get the land farm producing at a volume that would make leveling recipes practical.The sea people farm is great but comes at the minor cost that you must carry all of the grown food for the day that you pick it up. Potentially losing the entire harvest if you get killed by a shark on your run. We know they can swim to the surface. It would be an improvement if they could ship it to you.The Fish Farm SUCKS! At the beginning of every day you need to visit a series of menus to sell or harvest all your excess fish. They bind an entire button to selling or harvesting everything when the button everyone needs is harvest all BUT the two highest star of each fish. When you use the harvest all button it even warns you that you are screwing yourself. So fish farming is taking a boat to a room where you interact with 7 spreadsheets where you adjust the numbers on every cell one at a time. The menu even has unique key binds to master for performing the operation quickly. It still isn't game play. I loved collecting two 3* of every fish. I hated not knowing what Roe if any I was collecting or knowing what rate fish were growing or if expanding early produced more fish than leaving it at 99%.THE SUSHI RESTAURANTPlatinum rank secretly adds $2000 to your daily operating costs! Diamond rank secretly increases this cost to $5000! Ranking to Bronze, Silver, and Gold are all beneficial and should be gotten as fast as possible. You should sandbag on upgrading to platinum as long as you can. Normally low level workers have poor performance but low wages making for an even incline where you can afford to sell crappy low level fish and grow as you want. Once you hit platinum it creates a floor where every fish you sell needs to be worth $290 per piece to make the extra customers from platinum break even. MOST of the recipes in the entire game even at rank 10 do not generate $290 per unit.The optimal strategy is to spam your best recipe endlessly every night. This is a problem by itself. Platinum and later diamond force that strategy even if you weren't done with messing around with your menu. Reaching platinum makes night diving more costly as it is $2000 every night even if you spent a third of it under water.Picking the correct employees requires referencing a guide or making incredibly expensive trial an error. Money you need good employees to get.FISHING GUNSThe weapon crafting and upgrade system is hamstrung by unnecessary gold costs and too many overlapping options. The entire game can and should be played with a Level 1 Tranq Rifle for most of the run through. Live caught fish and their secret roe are more than THREE TIMES more valuable than dead ones. This makes most of the guns and their elemental variants useless and expensive ways to fail.Upgrading weapons requires a bunch of gathered resources that are fun to collect. Unfortunately because weapon upgrades also come with a hefty price tag they create an unnecessary opportunity cost. The stats of weapons are secret unless you expensively explore the tree and the end result is one minor variation on 18 ways to ruin fish. Fish should be weak to and stunned by a different element making live capture possible with more than just Tranq.Because you have no control of your Melee weapon or your Harpoon your gun MUST cover a universal role further narrowing the options to just sticking with the Tranq rifle. Leveling up guns in your inventory doesn't make them more powerful when found underwater so there is zero benefit to expanding your arsenal especially because gold costs rob the other game systems of growth. The game is great with a Tranq rifle I just wish the other options were less costly and more viable.",-0.0018748086929905184

"Posted: July 22A game with the heart of the ocean.Extremely addictive game, I played with keyboard and mouse, 100% achievement completion in 50 hours.GoodThe game is pack-full of content variety,lots of mini-gamesthat surprise you and includes references from other inspirations. Cooksta as your Instagram for foodies, Marinca fulfilling card collector's with the ""Gotta Fish Em All"", pink dolphin is a shiny! your otaku weeaboo stereotype, photo spot opportunities for memories, tomagatchi, osu rhythm game?, stealth missions, flappy birds-esque escape, shooting directors names and aliens (reminds me of nier automata), a segment out of a visual novel, seahorse racing, the list goes on.Gameplay loop involves diving down into the waters, catching fish during the day, afternoon, and maybe a 1/3 of the evening. After which you operate your sushi restaurant to generate income, then spend that income to upgrade your gear / upgrade your farms / train your staff (servers and cooks) to more effectively run Bancho sushi / buy interior designs for your shop, so many things to spend money on!The fish you catch are based on real-life species!?!beautiful 2D pixel art for characters in a 3D environment. Cutscenes are charming and full of character; they can be skipped after you've seen them too many times. Food art makes you crave sushi.Serviceable stories and soundtrack!Dave has the diver's peak physique - his blubber serves both as buoyancy and insulation in deep cold waters.User-friendly puzzles, can be a bit hand-holdy but don't need to consult a walk-through guide to do them. Also liked the availability of oxygen shells/tanks, ammo bullets and escape pods.single player can play two people at once in a certain point of the story.Lovely characters in the game. From the many people you can hire as staff to help out with the restaurant (Itsuki is super cute), the VIP's that enjoy the food or are there to compete, ofcourse Bancho the man himself displays sheer devotion to his craft, Cobra the weapons dealer who instigated the restaurant opportunity, there's heart and soul in all the characters, with vividly animated expressions. Sound design is really good too!Committing eco-terrorism is fun.Bad (Gripes)Fetch quests can get tedious and grindy.Not fun to lose all your items if you die. A dive can take 10~15 minutes and if you die (likely from sharks depleting your oxygen/health), you can only choose one item to keep, the rest are lost, alongside the time you spend trying to get those resources. Increasing cargo capacity also leads to longer dives if you are trying to fill it up completely.Spammy quick time events, you need to mash the space bar as quickly as possible to harpoon some bigger fish.Too addicting lmao, fast pace game that doesn't really give you room to breathe or to stop playing.Boss battles can be clunky sometimes due to being unable to maneuver faster than the enemy. To cheese them just overlevel your weapons and/or increase HP so that you lower their HP faster than they lower yours.Hitboxes can be a bit small, for instance trying to cargo a hammerhead shark you have to be right on its head or specific point to cargo it out.End-game can use more automated services like the water sprinkler in the farm e.g. each day I go to the farm to pull weeds and harvest rice + crops, there could be hire a farmer to do that for you. The fish farms need a lot of micro-management where you tend to send all but two of the same species so they can keep breeding.You should stay on Gold rank on Cooksta and not rank up to platinum or diamond until you have the sushi branch to generate extra income, which is acquired very late game. Reason is because it cuts ~$2000 profits due to set management costs.",0.07256813417190774

I'm over 40 - there is nothing good about only 3 hours of sleep for me anymore. Yet, this game...The controls are intuitive. Everything just makes sense, so there's not a big learning curve. You dive into the big blue hole and, once you know the button to press, your next steps just make sense. The tutorial gets you on board quickly. Many tutorials or new games can seem tedious if you restart them, but I've played through Dave the Diver dozens of times and the tutorial/progression has never really seemed like a deterrent to starting a new game.It is and has been surprisingly bug free, too. Professionally, I'm in quality assurance for a software company, so bugs... well, bug me and also jump out at me. Even in early access, Dave the Diver was surprisingly bug free. The developer(s) have been very responsive when bugs arise, quickly resolving the issue. Since the full release, they've heard us when we've run into bugs and have quickly resolved them.This game is the harpoon's tip, the tranc gun's tranquilizer, the parrot fish's beak, and the Trevally's scales - highly recommend!",0.20640948963317388
Posted: July 5Dave the diver is really fun.The first part of the game play is the fishing which plays well: Easy to control yet there's a skill level required for harder fish. The control scheme is where you have to hold down a button to aim then hit another to shoot. . . which will at times result in death if you're not too careful. Death is a really big deal early on for you won't have fish except for the one item you get to choose. That brings me to the next part. . . the bar.The other part of the game is running a sushi bar. For the bar part of the game you're running around trying to serve people and fill drinks. This starts as just you and then you can hire staff. This part is well done  and has a really interesting menu RPG thing going on.As you play more and more is introduced so there's always something new to explore.All and all a Strong recommendation of this title.,0.07624859708193041
"Posted: November 1, 2022Early Access ReviewThis is shaping up to be an incredible game so far.  The game play loop is extremely satisfying, the art style is charming, the humor lands, and the mechanics are just deep enough without becoming overbearing for a more casual player.  There really is something special here, and largely I just want to see more of the same for the final release.2 issues so far...The game works on Steam Deck but doesn't have the best performance, had to lock to 30 with some stutters - still playable but not perfect.IMO there should be more info for the sushi bar side of the game. It's tough to know what's selling well, what the stats and price impact, that kinda thing.  A better ""analytics"" or day end screen would help a lot to understand and influence what we put on our menus (and how much of it).",0.17218915343915345

"Posted: September 19The game is actually very enjoyable for 20+ hours with the game play loop broken by the constant introduction of new and new mechanics. The pixel graphics are beautiful.Basically, there's one place where the game fails, and that's in the basic mechanics. After a while you'll spend quite a bit of time diving and looting underwater stuff. So not just 3-5 minutes but up to an hour. However, the mechanics make sure that you can lose that hour of progress very easily, even if you've got your character very well equipped. Replaying a few minutes of diving is not a big deal, but losing an hour is definitely too big. 2-3 of those and you'll definitely be uninstall the game, because the last thing a player wants is to have their time wasted by the mechanics.So basically, the game is worth the money, but after 20+ hours it's a bit overthought for the basics themselves.",-0.025580808080808082
"Posted: January 13Early Access Reviewamazing game! amazing story! i love it all. 10/10. i dearly hope development will continue at a steady pace. i can see this game becoming something i come back to for many years, if done well. this is a game i would even buy dlc content for after its finished, thats how much i love it!the gameplay loops are constantly engaging and seeing your progress is satisfying. my only complaints is that i want more! i want bigger ocean maps and deeper depths to explore! im a huge fan of the layering of mechanics, maybe its a little too busy for some people, but perfect for me! theresfarming, fishing, boss fights, restaurant management, resource management, upgrading, exploration, story, minigames, wasting time on apps, etc.theres a lot going on but i think its done really well and wouldn't mind even a few more things to do!ive watched a few letsplayers try this game and they seem a little lost sometimes. people skip dialogue they need fairly often in this game and a dedicated mechanics explanation somewhere you can access at any time would be helpful for those kinds of players. also,the first quest where you kill a shark to unlock employees is very important and ive seen people become frustrated with how hard the game becomes in the restaurant phase if you postpone that quest for too long.also!! for some reason this game takes really long to launch for me? im not sure why and its not that important but i got very worried the first few times i launched the game and it wouldnt open!i have played the game for about 19 hours in early access and have finished the main quest with only 2 remaining quests to finish out. i payed 20$ for this and would say the experience is     worth the price.",0.07303703703703701
"Posted: June 30First, let me get some of the grievances, as there are some annoyances in this game that kind of rub me the wrong way.  However, let me also be clear.  This game is getting a glowing recommendation for me just because of how impressive and interesting it is.  Much of the faults are small things they likely could address/fix.Issues-------- If you at max carrying capacity and your swimming around hostile fish; if that fish hits you. (Especially the smaller ones)  They will literally sit inside your character frame and perpetually hit you while you won't be able to move out/strike back at them.  Only until you eventually get a octopus charm/upgrade that allows small dashes, do you have a avenue out of this problem.  Otherwise you're generally doomed to die, unless you swim out of the fishes range.- Death is immensely punishing, in a game that functions this way.  You'll lose everything in a dive besides one item.  This means, that in a game that is already at a breakneck pace, where events happen back-to-back, having a death is rather critical.  Many domino's can crash against you all at once, as your shop needs fish, and you need to keep maintaining profits in order to remain actively upgrading/working towards the next investment./ This however can be resolved at the point of death by force-closing the game.  It will then allow you to reload back before your dive.  Thus, this punishment is just a waste of time, because if all your going to do is require one to reload our save, then its not the best system for it./ The best solution to this would be to give the player a choice, during the death screen.  Do they just continue, and forgo the wasted time (which no one will do)  Or do you restart back at your boat, and do the dive over.  Which is the obvious solution.The player should only be pushed into the next day, when the player makes the choice to finish their dive willingly.  There are too many punishments otherwise.- I also would kind of like to have some time between events.  I never really get to enjoy the act of the dive/funneling my restaurant.  However, i do also think this is by design.  Much of my restaurant portion of the game is practically entirely automated at this point for me, as my workers operate faster than my character does.  So it's actually a determent for me to bus tables.It would be nice to have a mastery system/ranking system for your own character, or perhaps just be more involved on top of the current system in the restaurant.  This however may just be the game being shorter then i realise.  Since my restaurant is close to diamond rating, and there doesn't seem to be any reputation advances past that.-------------That's my general gripes out of the way.---This game has numerous interlacing systems that work and compliment each other.  Your encouraged to always find the best way to capture/acquire fish.  As it yields the most resources, this in-turn is like a expert hunter ensuring they target the best and most critical points of their prey to make the most of it.The game has a robust system involving the weapons, one part I won't spoil but when I discovered it I had both a chuckle and was excited for it.I enjoy the mini-cut-scenes, as well the 'Food war' style scenes of people interacting and eating the sushi for the first time.  I really hope this game either gets a endless mode, or a dlc that allows you to multi-manage many other Sushi shops, including having added chefs.  There are so many avenue's to increase your fish yield, that it makes sense to have more establishments.  (It may, and i just haven't reached it yet.  But I kind of doubt it, given the narrative of the game.)It has a Terraria-esq system, where you are constantly diving deeper and deeper into the ocean.  Explore more and more dangerous biomes, which in-that only keep increasing the different array of fish you run across.  I'm half expecting to reach a molten sea-floor section, or some Doomy cthulu region at this point.-In the end.  Really hope the devs do a ton with this game.  I can see a lot of area of growth and added systems.  Perhaps extra/different shops with different sea areas/starting points.  Just as this game can easily hit elaborate and larger sequels, if that's the route it takes.  I'm sure it'll be a hit.",0.12765151515151513

"Posted: July 22- How can such a simple loop turn into one of the best indie games in recent time?I am not kidding when I say, I think Dave the diver is one of the best Indie games in a while for me personally. So much love and care went into this title you can tell from beginning to end how much they loved the game they made. Without further ado let’s get into why I think this game is simply amazing.- StoryTo begin with our journey let’s talk about the story….. Which I will actually keep short. One of the beauties of this game is really going in blind not knowing anything about it. To keep it at a basic level you play as Dave who becomes a diver to gather fish so you can run a sushi bar at night. There is so much more that happens but its best going in as blind as possible since it was truly a joy experiencing everything the story had to offer. In the end I thought the story was very good, engaging and surprisingly emotional at times.- GameplayThis is where the game shines the most for me personally as the gameplay is outright phenomenal. The basic gameplay loop has you start a day , dive into the ocean twice to gather things then run the sushi bar at night with the fish you gathered. It sounds simple but it is insanely addicting and fun trying to find new fish , swim deeper, get new dishes for your menu, get new workers for your place. Furthermore as you progress in the game it opens up in so many ways that I won’t spoil as like I said in the story portion will surprise you in many ways. I feel like even if you aren’t into this genre of games you can easily fall in love with what dave the diver has to offer as it's so casual and just simply fun to play. Lots of fish to gather , lots of dishes to unlock and lots of love to experience. In the end it is such a basic gameplay loop that keeps you engaged throughout the game all while opening up more and more and more and more to the point where you will say “just how many things will this game add??????” during your playthrough. There is an insane amount of gameplay mechanics I didn’t dive into (pun intended) because I just want you all to experience everything as fresh as can. Just know it's amazing and I really have no complaints with this game.I never once found an issue outside of small nitpicks.- CharactersThe whole cast is loveable from the main cast all the way to the side cast. Not much else to say in this section LOL- PresentationI love it when games go for a pixel artstyle all while having a more modern environment setting. Dave the diver looks amazing and also sounds amazing as the OST is a slapper!. The whole game just feels peaceful and will make you feel very at peace with yourself as you play it.- In the endI adored my time thoroughly with this game and still continue to play even now as once you finish the game you can continue going through loops and unlock even more things. In the end this game is an amazing bundle for the price of only $20 you will EASILY get your money's worth out of this game…. What are you doing? Buy the darn game already !",0.15836219336219332
"Posted: October 30, 2022Early Access ReviewJust Amazing.Great casual scuba experience, there's no real pressure to push yourself, some minor obstacles, nasty fish and currents.. and some shaaRKKS AGGGHH to worry about however they've easily avoided till your brave enough to serve them on your dinner plates (they sell for pretty good cash).There are so many amazing cut scenes, i have come to this game after watching spalltercat plating it and never actually playing the demo myself to falling completely in love with it. Just when you thought things couldn't get more amazing they hit that button!The dream mini game just set me into a new dimension of gaming / just complete randomness thrown into a game.If your into retro / new game genre's then this is a definite game to take.There's a good 20 hours in early access (if you try to track down your seahorse goals, not sure about rest of the fish in the included depths we get.

I've also not experience any bugs so far in my 6 hours of play. I'd highly recommend this game! I really hope they'll add more to it during early access and I hope the add additional save slots as my daughter would also love to have her own save game.For transparency I was one of the winners of the 30 free keys the devs gave out in the first community give away so I received this game for free, however I had been intending to buy the game on day 1 and I would have fully thought it was worth the asking price.

"Posted: July 9This “do not recommend” is simply for people who may have low vision issues, those who play on handheld, and people who need accessibility options like toggle/hold or hold/tap etc.I did my research before buying and already knew there were some things like QTEs and button mashing parts which I always feel should be an option in these types of games but I bought it anyway. This review is discounting these issues as I was aware before purchase.In my short time playing I encountered some things that fall short to being suitable for ALL steam deck of any handheld players, everything is tiny. This includes your characters, objects in the environment and the text.There are random flashes of white screen on some screen changes or after certain events. I’m a frequent JRPG player so this is nothing new to me, but it doesn’t make it any less annoying especially when you’re playing in bed at night in the dark.I think overall it needs a ton of accessibility options like the ones I initially mentioned. You have to hold buttons down for many things rather than having the option to just press, why?While this game is amazing (though incidentally I find the actual fishing in this game tedious) I know no one will see these issues unless I rate it as a do not recommend for the people who need to know about these things. I’m also hoping the developers do something about it like people have been asking for on the forum with no acknowledgment.Lastly, QTEs and losing items when you run out of oxygen automatically make this game NOT casual in my opinion.",-0.02775280275280275

"Posted: July 18It was hard to decide where to fall on the thumb direction front here.  Dave the Diver is an attractive game, with a fun story.  The varied mechanics of exploration, fishing, management, etc. keep you engaged with the grind without it becoming boring and they do a really good job of slowly opening up new complexity as the story progresses.But.The game heavily relies on QTE mechanics for most of the fishing.  This seems original at first, but becomes old fast.  Eventually you'll see it at best as a way to slowly break your controller, at worst as a shocking absence of accessibility.  Some of the motions, on the wider grip of the Steam Deck, can even become painful.  They also don't work very well when performance dips.  The interface also struggles when you have multiple options - it offers button prompts that won't react because you are either moving, not in perfect pixel position for their trigger, or there is another overlapping prompt that causes you to do something unexpected.Performance was initially good on the Steam Deck, but over the course of patching (or potentially game progress) it has gone into the (fish) tank.  This makes a lot of the game difficult to achieve when it requires good timing, and it's unpleasant to play.Many of the boss fights are just not fun to play.  There's a trick to each one, and once you find it that's fine, but often it's very easy to think you've done the right thing but the game doesn't register it because their alignment of action to graphics seems off.  Sometimes they seem just downright un-fun - because your health and oxygen and therefore dashing are all linked, you can get yourself into a position where you might as well give up and reset the fight as you literally don't have the resources to do it.  It's like a bad puzzle that also relies on janky AI and badly tuned models.I think overall I've got to thumb the game down.  As usual, a game ruined by a lack of testing and reviews that are too busy fawning over prettiness to actually consider the real issues with the game.",-0.03944172041110817
"Posted: June 30Yeah, this is the one right here.When you put business management alongside the inventory that you’re acquiring, that gameplay loop can become very addictive. At first you just play and catch every fish you see, going back to the dilapidated restaurant to make basic dishes. Over time you ignore the smaller and go for the bigger as equipment gets upgraded, you start to focus specific fish at specific depths to take to the restaurant. You begin to realize this game plays a little like Hades where the biomes and regions remain the same, but the level itself and the enemies/resources you encounter are procedurally generated between each dive. Those drums and guitar  that you hear when you go through Tartarus starts to play in your head as the harpoon gun gets a different element applied to it for extra damage, or you find a new blueprint of a lethal gun to use on predators. You go from little fishy sushi’s to shark heads and eel curry, the green bar that shows income for the day towers over yesterday’s green bar….the brain makes the chemical.Then you start to focus on just getting those sharks or eels to enhance it at the restaurant, which will in turn increase the price of the dish as well as the ratings to the customer. The once dilapidated restaurant now completely customized. Residual income becomes available through farms, you start throwing a pinch of stardew valley in game that didn’t even ask for it, but goodness gracious me did it not just improve upon the experience, giving you a fail safe option for making money when you fail during a run, which only lets you bring back 1 item you had found. It also lets you choose a quest item as that 1 item to bring back instead of an expensive fish. Social media becomes a pivotal component in the demand for the restaurant, holidays occur that bring in specific guests wanting to pay more for specific meals, making you go from the shark grind to a grind for jellyfish, mini games and side quests appear, you get a plethora of content trickled in slowly, just right when you think to yourself you’re getting used to it.All while this is happening you are playing a story that is not forcing you to go out of your way, as you will most likely find where you need to go to progress just through progressing further down, and to the right. This is the way you’re naturally motivated to go. Longer and deeper runs will feel rewarding, progress will be made visually, as well as in gameplay. The music is very well done, whoever composed this material knew what they were working with, almost makes you feel like it was not outsourced to another composer.You get up, go to work, come home, play the shooty bang bang with the boys, or run the Diablo dungeons, it’s 9pm, and you’re unwinding, what do you play? Or better yet you’re one of those that get up early before work to sneak an hour of game, you really feel like getting on Diablo at 7am? You might, but I’d think you’re either crazy, or a father with a baby keeping you up all night to have no track of time. Let’s say you’re not crazy though, what do you play?This is the one, right here.",0.028078403078403074

"Posted: July 27Difficult to recommend to be honest.This game is the embodiment of jack of all trades but master of none.The deciding factor is that the game has a lot of charm and obviously a lot of love has been put into it.The issue is that while the game has many different aspects to it from fishing to farming to running a restaurant, none of them are really that deep or developed.  Some of them could be outright ignored, and even if you decided to put your all into any of the side gigs you won't be rewarded for the effort. The game does well giving you new things over the course of the story, but those events are shallow.  Also the game currently has a bad habit of multiple events happening at the same time.  I had a storm event, VIP event, and a festival event happen on the same night.  It cheaped the lot of it.",-0.08405103668261561

"Posted: July 24I find it hard to simply recommend or not recommend this game, but since the current reviews are overwhelmingly positive I want to emphasize the flaws and hopefully things can be improved in the future.This game was very fun at the beginning - exploring the ocean, fishing and cooking, all the cool cut scene animations and new features...I would rate 10/10 if the whole game experience can maintain that level.However, as the story proceed, the diving parts become painful - no map, often have to swim long distance with a slow speed, boring tasks and super boring puzzles & hard and sudden battles...some boss fights and chasing fights are absolutely terrible. The last region, particularly, feels very empty, and exploring it with little direction was not rewarding at all, only to find I should return later to proceed story.In short - this game has many enjoyable contents, but I feel that because they are trying to pack as many as possible in the game, they didn't have time to balance/test every part very well, resulting in some bad game experience especially later in the game. Given the price I have to say I'm a bit disappointed, so if you really want to give it a try, I would suggest wait for a good discount.",-0.12017135642135643
"Posted: November 12, 2022Early Access ReviewA diamond at the bottom of the sea. If you grew up in the era of Flash games and Newgrounds this game is for you. It’s hard to say there is some major innovation or new ground-breaking ideas adding something to the genre, but the devs made sure to polish every detail to make it look gorgeous.Now, remember this is an early access game. There are plenty of bugs and game can crash out making you lose the progress (30-40 minutes of gameplay). I had to restart the entire game (only one save for playthrough) because of one scene not loading properly locking me out of the further part of game. So yeah, so far the optimisation is pretty “meh”, but this is an early access game. Checking the log you will see the devs are doing everything they can to make it look and work better.

"Posted: July 9Solid gameplay loop blending a Steamworld Dig style Go-Down-To-Collect-Resources-So-You-Can-Go-More-Down with a fairly robust restaurant management sim. Definitely enough there to keep you busy for 30+ hours.Where the game really shines is in the animations. Clean, vibrant, full of humour and personality. This game wears its references proudly and shows a ton of love. Basic gameplay is broken up from time to time with minigames and quicktime events that add a bit of savour to a fairly repetitive skeleton.The localization is noticeably rough in places, which isn't the worst but it can be jarring.My main issue is with the pacing. There are a couple of collectibles in the game - collector cards earned by filling out your fish-o-pedia and playing a tamagotchi-inspired subgame, and a weekly hunt quest where you are tasked with capturing a unique fish.The tamagotchi game, GYAO, involves feeding, cleaning, and entertaining a fish that can grow into one of 20 forms and then dies. This takes about a week in-game, and I was able to get maybe 2 forms by the time I finished the story and decided I'd had enough of the game.The monster hunts are also a weekly event and, again, unlock too late in the story to really get you through the list in time.This isn't really an issue as such, just that the game with only a couple variations on each of its five explorable zones doesn't provide quite enough meat to keep any but the most dedicated completionists playing.That aside, this has become one of my favourite games of the year and, much like vampire survivors, is perfectly suited to dipping in and out once in a while when the mood strikes.",0.0840909090909091

"Posted: July 17Believe it or not, it is a thousand times easier to talk about an awful game than it is a good game, because you can only same ""game good"" in so many ways. It is exceedingly difficult to talk about a game like Dave the Diver that is so impressive in every aspect. There is so little bad about this game, that the worst I could come up with was that the load times on transitions between zones are a little long. Thats it. To be perfectly clear, as a product that you purchase and take price into account, this is essentially flawless. 20 bucks at full price is genuinely too cheap, so take advantage of it and get yourself an amazing game for less than 2 coffees at Starbucks. The game being 20 bucks also probably plays into why it has already sold over a million copies at the time of review, but you get my point.I made a meme'd up video talking about why I think this game has succeeded as much as it has if you wanna check it out:YouTube™ Video:Why Dave the Diver is one of the best games of 2023 (Review)Views: 582With 1 MILLION copies of Dave the Diver being sold in the first 10 days since the game launched, the question must be asked... how the f*ck you sell that much, Dave?Now, how the f*ck do I even review this...Well, back to basics. Art: I don't know how they managed to do what they did but every part of this game is gorgeous to look at. There's this great mix of 2d and 3d when diving where the background pops but you still are only moving on a 2D plane. The colors are vibrant, the zones all feel very distinct, the fish are all very creative and the ocean feels *very* alive. Even just from a visuals perspective, diving in this game is a joy to look at. The UI work is also extremely impressive. Every menu is related to what you are doing. You open up your phone and open an app to look at guns to buy, you open up your gun dealer's computer and see him typing at the bottom of the screen to look at upgrades. There's those sh*tty bluetooth apps to check on your crops, a tamogatchi, and about 100 other aspects of the visual design that are impressive, not to mention all of the pop culture references that never feel played out in any way.Thats another thing I feel I need to mention. You'll read a lot of reviews talking about how theres SO MUCH in this game, and they are right, but the team at MINTROCKET have put in what I can only imagine took far too many hours of work to ensure that its never overwhelming. The mechanics of the game roll out at a good pace so it never feels stale, but they all work together to create a cohesive and genuinely relaxing experience.Both the diving and the restaurant management aspects of Dave are great, no notes. Buying Dave the Diver is like getting 3 or 4 games that would normally cost 20 dollars apiece all rolled into one, because there is that much allowing you to really set yourself up to succeed in the world of Dave.The music is great, the visual feedback on actions is great, the cutscenes are unbelievably funny, the boss design is solid, and the only thing of note to MAYBE criticise is how simple the characters are, but honestly? A deep story would feel out of place here, and I think they all serve a purpose very well.Thats the best praise I can give Dave the Diver, it feels like they knew what they wanted to do, and did it. I don't know how they managed to take so many different game aspects and roll them all into one cohesive ball stuck inside a wetsuit, but they did, and this game deserves every ounce of success its getting. I'm happy to throw my review onto the stack with the rest of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. If this game didnt come out in one of the most stacked years in gaming in a hot minute, I wouldnt be surprised to see it get a GOTY nomination or two.
